\chapter{IntervalFrag}\label{ch:interval}

This section describes the IntervalFrag algorithm, and the proposed architecture needed to implement the enhancements to the FragCubing's algorithm.

\section{Using Intervals in Inverted Indexes}\label{ch:interval:problem}

- What problem are we trying to solve?

- The idea

\section{Algorithm}\label{ch:interval:algo}

- Simple implementation overview

- Insertion in the index

- Using iceberg conditions

- The Intersection problem and algorithm

- The skew influence

- Mention that there are ways to improve the algorithm further, and that they are further mentioned in appendix A

\section{Results}\label{ch:interval:results}

- Have this section here or coalesce on the next one? Might be too big already
