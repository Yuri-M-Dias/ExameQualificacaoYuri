  abstract = {For the operation of Mars rovers the ground team has a set of utilities to generate safe mission planning. A relevant aspect of such planning are the paths that the rover has to to follow to reach the scientific objectives. For path planning, operators use a combination of orbital and surface imagery to analyze the terrain topography to generate a cost map. Applying path planning algorithms over the cost map it is possible to obtain (sub)optimal solutions to safely drive the rover through different waypoints. As well, the paths obtained can be assessed using simulators and handmade improved by means of Virtual Reality techniques. In this paper we present an integrated planner for the mission planning and its evaluation using the recent technological advances in Virtual Reality. We have developed a low cost application to provide a three-dimensional view of the path generated exploiting real Mars surfaces with the aim of helping operators in deciding the best paths to follow.},

This paper describes the solutions adopted in the solver of the Sensor Planning System, part of the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) Preparatory Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). The goal of this solver is to find a feasible conflict-free assignment of a set of objects to be tracked by a set of sensors, given several constraints. We use an off-the-shelf temporal planner to solve this problem, Optic. A key aspect of this task is that problems are usually huge. Thus, current temporal planners can not solve those problems directly. We explain first how to model the problem as a temporal planning problem, and then we present an approach for partitioning the problem in order to be able to solve it that allows a multi-core processing. The experimental results, both with simulated and real data, confirm the approach is useful for solving target problems of realistic size.},

  title = {Evolutionary {{Computation}} for the {{ARIEL Mission Planning Tool}}},
  abstract = {The ARIEL mission main goal is the measurement of atmospheres of transiting planets. This requires the observation of two types of events: primary and secondary eclipses. In order to yield measurements of sufficient Signal-to-Noise Ratio to fulfill the mission objectives, the events of each exoplanet have to be observed several times. In addition, several criteria have to be considered to carry out each observation, such as the exoplanet visibility, its event duration, its potential significance in the survey, and no overlapping with other tasks. Consequently, obtaining a long term mission plan becomes unaffordable for human planners due to the complexity of computing the huge number of possible combinations for finding an optimum solution. In this contribution we present a mission planning tool based on Evolutionary Algorithms, which are focused on solving optimization problems such as the planning of several tasks. Specifically, the proposed tool finds a solution that highly optimizes the defined objectives, which are based on the maximization of the time spent on scientific observations and the scientific return. The results obtained on the large experimental set up support that the proposed scheduler technology is robust and can function in a variety of scenarios, offering a competitive performance which does not depend on the collection of exoplanets to be observed.},

  abstract = {Intelligent systems capabilities are increasing and its application to robotics has become largely popular. Some literature has been produced about autonomous controllers for robotics, demonstrating that they can face a variety of domains. However, we can observe that the experiments performed lack of a common scientific methodology. Generally, isolated case studies are presented, without providing enough details to enable other researchers to replicate or to compare their works with the previous results in the field. The aim of this work is to contribute defining and operationalizing a framework for plan-based controllers assessment. Such effort is supported on a set of generally applicable metrics to entail evaluation of different aspects of robotics controllers. Besides these metrics, we have used OGATE, a domain independent tool that automatically carries on with controller assessments. Then, following a well-defined methodology, we are able to generate reproducible benchmarks, providing objective evidences of the experiments performed. To test our framework, we have used two plan-based controllers on the same robotic problem and platform. Results show that we are able to extract relevant data, allowing comparison of different autonomous controllers.},

We show that the proposed pipeline is superior in accuracy to the models currently used by MEX's operators. We also demonstrate that machine learning can provide the operators with insight about the orbiter's thermal behavior.

  title = {Machine {{Learning}} for {{Spacecraft Operations Support}} - {{The Mars Express Power Challenge}}},
  abstract = {Mars Express (MEX) has been orbiting Mars, generating great science for over 13 years. The aging spacecraft faces challenges; eclipse seasons are getting longer, eclipse durations are increasing and battery degradation is worsening. Accurate power modelling, respecting the power budget, becomes more vital as this ensures MEX health and maximum science. Empirical thermal power models provide reliable long term predictions but lack sensitivity. Telemetry data accumulated during the mission is a rich information source from which to derive a new model. This paper shows how the MEX Flight Control Team released 3 Martian years of data and reached out to Machine Learning (ML) enthusiasts asking them to predict a fourth year of spacecraft telemetry. In return, the participants were invited to an open data day to meet the MEX operators, tour ESA and find out about many exciting missions, and present and share their solutions with other candidates and ESA staff members. But the reward of solving a complex challenge, in a novel environment for space application, lead an incredible response from the worldwide ML community. Using open source solutions, candidates built data-driven models which have been able to predict the power consumption of 33 thermal lines, every hour, over a full Martian year (687 Earth days). These models improve sensitivity and accuracy by an order of magnitude. The number of scientific observations may increase even during power constrained periods when incorporating such models into MEX mission planning. By releasing spacecraft data and engaging with ML communities, ESA has gained a novel means to better exploit spacecraftresources, increase scientific return, and so, prolong mission life.},

  title = {Machine {{Learning}} in {{Spacecraft Ground Systems}}},
  abstract = {A machine learning approach for the operational situational awareness (OSA) in flight operations is presented. The spacecraft health and safety telemetry are generally time dependent and periodical. The machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, are used to capture the time dependent trend of the telemetry datasets characterized by their data patterns and noise level, which provides a direct insights into the health and safety status of telemetry datasets. As the time dependent trends are highly sensitive to changes above the noise level, the potential anomalies can be detected at much early stage, which leads to a more proactive flight operations and a more resilient system. The challenges for the machine-learning approach in the spacecraft ground system are to develop a systematic, accurate, adaptive and efficient data training strategy, and a representation to meet persistent requirement. The focus of this paper is to present a machine-learning approach for the time dependent trending of spacecraft datasets with arbitrary scales. The data training algorithms have been developed and implemented in neural networks, which are shown to generate highly accurate time dependent trend. The OSA tool, ASRC Intelligent Monitoring System (AIMS), is presented, which implements the machine-learning algorithm. The extensions of machine-learning algorithms in developing capabilities to improve the mission efficiency and enable more autonomous operations are discussed.},

  abstract = {Design principles gathered from over 20 years of experience in research, implementing and protecting mission critical flight systems used by the Navigation and Mission Design Section at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory are reviewed. The work of spacecraft navigation involves rigorous requirements for accuracy and completeness, often carried out under uncompromising critical time pressures. Robust and fault tolerant design for the ground data system is crucial for the numerous space missions we support, from the Mars rover Curiosity to Cassini in orbit around Saturn. We begin by examining the design principles learned from fault tolerant design efforts to protect against random failure, and consider computer security engineering as a derivative effort to protect against intelligent actors promoting malicious failure. Examples for best practices of reliable system design from computer and aviation industry are considered and security fault tolerance principles are derived from this effort. Computer security design approaches are reviewed, both as abstract principles (starting from cornerstones in Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and from implementation. Strategic design principles such as defense in depth, least privilege, and vulnerability removal are used in this design. We evaluate system design from external access data flows, through internal host security mechanisms, and finally to user access controls. A complementary intersection - the balance between the protection of the system and promoting its ease of use by engineers (making their experience as user friendly and efficient as possible) is evaluated. Finally, we consider future refinements to secure system architecture.},

  abstract = {A single thruster attitude and de-orbital control method is proposed, capable of delivering a small spin stabilized probe with payload to the surface of an airless body such as the Moon. Nutation removal, attitude control and fast large angle maneuvers have been demonstrated and shown to be effective using a model of a commercially available single standard cold gas pulse width modulated controlled thruster. Maximum final impact angle due to drift and residual velocities was found to be less than 5 degrees and the maximum angle of attack to be 4 deg. The conventional 3-axis control would require as many as twelve thrusters a more substantial structure with complex pipe-work, and a more sophisticated controller. The single thruster concept reduces launch mass and thus cost of the mission, making the concept of small networked surface probes for extended science missions more viable. Experiments based on computer simulation have shown that strict design and mission profile requirements can be fulfilled using the single thruster control method.},

Having a standard format for describing the telemetry and command formats allows for the development or adoption of compatible tools and significantly reduces the amount of custom software development often needed to ensure all system components have access to consistent format definitions. The main objective of this paper is to show how powerful XTCE is in terms of interoperability across organizations. This paper summarizes work which entailed converting the mission telemetry database for a current NASA mission, in XTCE format, into several target mission operation databases associated with different telemetry and command toolchains, and then, comparing the results of the telemetry processing and display. The target toolchains selected were Ball Aerospace/COSMOS, NASA-GSFC/ITOS (Goddard Space Flight Center/Integrated Test and Operations System), and NASA-AMMOS/AMPCS (Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System/Mission Data Processing and Control System) - all real-time telemetry and command processing systems.},

  shorttitle = {Solar {{Orbiter Observing Plans}} for {{Understanding}} the {{Physics}} of {{Solar Energetic Particles}}},
  abstract = {Solar Orbiter is a European Space Agency mission dedicated to Solar and Heliospheric Physics, currently planned for launch in February 2019. Due to its telemetry limitation, the mission planning should be carefully done to maximize scientific return. This work defines and simulates the scientific plan to address all sub-objectives under general Objective 3 of the Solar Orbiter mission: 'how do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?' Five new complete Solar Orbiter Observing Plans (SOOPs), for coordinating operations from several (up to 10) instruments, are defined. The SOOPs are scheduled in the Medium-Term Periods (MTPs) within the Science Activity Plan of the full mission, following specific planning strategies, which consider telemetry downlink rates and specific Sun-Earth-S/C configurations. The MTPs are coded and simulated to check when the instruments will be switched on and off and what the resource usage will be, in terms of power and telemetry generation, against the mission's constraints. Before running the code in Experiment Planning Software (EPS), the Objective 3 SOOP timelines are checked with Sous-Chef, a visualization tool for individual instrument observations and SOOPs. The results obtained prove that the process fully addresses Solar Orbiter Objective 3 and it is valid for planning and simulation. It could also be easily adapted to suit other needs in the future, like different trajectories or scientific alternatives, in order to have the best output for science and operations.},

  abstract = {Routing in Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) requires specific solutions as link impairments prevent the use of ordinary Internet algorithms, based on a timely dissemination of network topology information. Among DTN routing algorithms there is a dichotomy between opportunistic and deterministic (scheduled) solutions. The former are numerous and apply to terrestrial environments; CGR is the most widely supported algorithm designed for scheduled connectivity, and it is usually applied to space networks. However, in an attempt to provide a unified approach, an opportunistic variant of CGR, Opportunistic CGR (OCGR) has been recently proposed by some of the authors. Performance evaluations are normally carried out for opportunistic solutions by means of simulators, such as The ONE considered in this paper. CGR by contrast is more often studied by means of small testbeds. As the simulation approach could be complementary for CGR, and essential for OCGR, the authors have recently ported both of them into The ONE, by developing and releasing as free software a specific additional package. The aim of this paper is to show the rationale of this choice and discuss the many challenges that needed to be tackled to achieve this primary goal.},

  abstract = {Autonomous mobile robots use vision sensors for navigation due to its ability to provide detailed information of the environment. Visual perception of an environment, is an important capability for mobile robots, so many efforts are leading the research community for such a fundamental and challenging task. An aspect to emphasize is that vision systems have to cope with uncertainty because sensors have noise and the previous knowledge is unclear or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty estimation model applied to an object detection system. The vision system is designed to recognize objects in usual human environments, working on a mobile robot. To calculate the uncertainty, we consider the model accuracy of the system, the probability of detection after the prediction process and the empirical probability of detecting each object according to the distance. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of incorporating uncertainty information into an object detection system. Finally, the results motivate us to continue improving the uncertainty model in order to use the information generated to strengthen mobile robot navigation systems, as well as for the development of a place categorization system.},

This paper focuses on the understanding of the current system and protocols used in Interplanetary communication. This paper is mainly based on the study of different layers of CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems) protocol, which is the recommended protocol used by all the Space Communication Organizations including NASA. The resources used for this paper are mainly reports from CCSDS, NASA and JPL. This paper will pave the easier way of studying and understanding of Interplanetary Network. In the CCSDS protocol Stack, Security is shown as a protocol layer. But, the reality is, every layer has its own security concerns. In this paper, we have tried to reflect this idea too.},

  abstract = {Pressures on natural resources are increasing and a number of challenges need to be overcome to meet the needs of a growing population in a period of environmental variability. Some of these environmental issues can be monitored using remotely sensed Earth Observations (EO) data that are increasingly available from a number of freely and openly accessible repositories. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized. They remain still underutilized mainly because of their complexity, increasing volume, and the lack of efficient processing capabilities. EO Data Cubes (DC) are a new paradigm aiming to realize the full potential of EO data by lowering the barriers caused by these Big data challenges and providing access to large spatio-temporal data in an analysis ready form. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) will significantly reduce the burden on EO data users. Nevertheless, ARD are not commonly produced by data providers and therefore getting uniform and consistent ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to enable rapid data access and pre-processing to generate ARD using interoperable services chains. The approach has been tested and validated generating Landsat ARD while building the Swiss Data Cube.},

Based on the concept of data cube, the entire forest is a data cube, each individual tree as a basic data cube. By using the data cube design by us, we could construct the virtual forest on different scale using less computer memory. With the help of the visualization system, we can compute the spatial construction information of the forest and adjust the spatial structure, providing a basic platform and virtual environment for other researchers to study spatial structure of forest.},

Computing a data cube requires a long sequence of basic operations and storage costs. Exponentially accumulating amounts of data have reached a magnitude that overwhelms the processing capacities of single computers. In this paper, we implement a large-scale data cube computation based on distributed parallel computing using the MapReduce (MR) computational framework. For this purpose, we developed a new algorithm, MRDataCube, which incorporates the MR mechanism into data cube computations such that effective data cube computations are enabled even when using the same computing resources. The proposed MRDataCube consists of two-level MR phases, namely, MRSpread and MRAssemble. The main feature of this algorithm is a continuous data reduction through the combination of partial cuboids and partial cells that are emitted when the computation undergoes these two phases. From the experimental results we revealed that MRDataCube outperforms all other algorithms.},

In some cases, radiation-induced effects are of a low probability and can be ignored; however, radiation effects must be considered when designing systems that have a high mean time to failure requirement, an impact on protection, and/or higher exposure to radiation. High-energy physics power systems suffer from a combination of these effects: a high mean time to failure is required, failure can impact on protection, and the proximity of systems to accelerators increases the likelihood of radiationinduced events. This paper presents the principal radiation-induced effects, and radiation environments typical to high-energy physics. It outlines a procedure for designing and validating radiation-tolerant systems using commercial off-the-shelf components. The paper ends with a worked example of radiation-tolerant power converter controls that are being developed for the Large Hadron Collider and High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider at CERN.},

  title = {The {{Amazonia}}-1 Satellite's Ground Segment - Challenges for Implementation of the Space Link Extension Protocol Services},
  abstract = {Amazonia-1 is the first Remote Sensing Satellite entirely  developed at Brazil by National Institute for Space Research  (INPE) and it is expected to be concluded in 2018. Amazonia-1 is a  polar orbit satellite that will generate images with a 5 days  revisit period. To do this, has a wide sight optical imager,  called Wide Field Imager (WFI), able to observe a range of 700 km  with 70 meters of spatial resolution. Its rapid revisit feature  will enable Amazon deforestation alert data to improve in real  time by maximizing the acquisition of useful images in the face of  cloud cover in the region. The Amazonia-1 will also provide  frequent images of Brazilian areas, and may be useful in other  environmental monitoring applications, such as the coastal zone,  water reservoirs, forests of other biomes and natural disasters.  The Amazonia-1 satellite is based on the Multi-Mission Platform  (MMP), which was also developed by INPE and other Brazilian  industries as a part of the National Program of Space Activities  (PNAE), coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). The MMP  is generic platform to 500 kg class satellites. With 250 kg mass,  it provides the necessary resources, in terms of power, control,  communication and others to operate, in orbit, a payload of up to  280 kg. The requirement of high rate of revisits and the need of  controlling and data reception of other remote sensing satellites  available in Brazil, for example, the CBERS (26 days to revisit)  impose new challenges for the ground segment, related to control  system of orbit and attitude and consequently in the reception,  processing and distribution of data through the ground segment  using the Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol Services. The SLE  protocol services establish activities, based on the Consultative  Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for cross support  recommendations, including Management Services for Data Transfer  and SLE protocol services related to Telemetry and Telecommand.  These services standards have been adopted by the different space  agencies, such as: ESA, NASA, CNES, DLR, ASI, JAXA, INPE, to  performing tracking and controlling of the spacecrafts. This paper  presents an overview of the Amazonia-1 satellites ground segment,  its objectives, the satellite design based in the Multi-Mission  Platform (MMP) and also the preparation of the ground segment for  the operation with the SLE Protocol and allow for efficient  operations with cross support.},

  abstract = {Este trabalho apresenta um estudo de avalanche t{\'e}rmica em um  sistema de carga e descarga de baterias em sat{\'e}lites  artificiais. Para tanto, desenvolve-se um modelo baseado em  prin{\'c}\i{}pios macrosc{\'o}picos, o qual pode ser  generalizado para uma ampla variedade de topologias de suprimento  de energia e tecnologias de bateria. A partir do modelo obtido,  identifica-se a propriedade emergente de avalanche t{\'e}rmica, a  qual ocorre no sistema quando todos os equipamentos est{\~a}o  acoplados e interagindo uns com os outros. Mostra-se que esta  propriedade {\'e} decorrente da intera{\c c}{\~a}o dos efeitos  da efici{\^e}ncia de carga da bateria, degrada{\c c}{\~a}o de  par{\^a}metros do sistema e modo de opera{\c c}{\~a}o do  sat{\'e}lite.

ABSTRACT: In  this work, we present a study of thermal avalanche on an  artificial satellite battery charging and discharging system. To  do so, we develop a model based on macroscopic principles which  can be generalized to a wide variety of topologies, power supply  and battery technologies. From the model obtained, we identify the  emergent property of thermal avalanche in the system which arises  when we consider the interactions between equipment. We show that  this avalanche effect is due to the interaction of battery  parameters such as efficiency or double-layer capacitance,  degradation of system parameters and the operational modes of the  system. Having identified the causes of thermal instability, we  develop a new metric, based on graphical methods, obtained from  the Poincar{\'e} map, enabling the establishment of a stability  margin, as well as the identification of the threshold for  triggering a thermal avalanche.},

  isbn = {978-1-4841-2083-5},
  abstract = {This book provides a basic, conceptual-level description of engineering management disciplines that relate to the development and life cycle management of a system. For the non-engineer it provides an overview of how a system is developed. For the engineer and project manager it provides a basic framework for planning and assessing system development. Information in the book is from various sources, but a good portion is taken from lecture material developed for the two Systems Planning, Research, Development, and Engineering courses offered by the Defense Acquisition University. The book is divided into four parts: Introduction; Systems Engineering Process; Systems Analysis and Control; and Planning, Organizing, and Managing. The first part introduces the basic concepts that govern the systems engineering process and how those concepts fit the Department of Defense acquisition process. Chapter 1 establishes the basic concept and introduces terms that will be used throughout the book. The second chapter goes through a typical acquisition life cycle showing how systems engineering supports acquisition decision making. The second part introduces the systems engineering problem-solving process, and discusses in basic terms some traditional techniques used in the process. An overview is given, and then the process of requirements analysis, functional analysis and allocation, design synthesis, and verification is explained in some detail. This part ends with a discussion of the documentation developed as the finished output of the systems engineering process. Part three discusses analysis and control tools that provide balance to the process. Key activities (such as risk management, configuration management, and trade studies) that support and run parallel to the system engineering process are identified and explained. Part four discusses issues integral to the conduct of a systems engineering effort, from planning to consideration of broader management issues. In some chapters supplementary sections provide related material that shows common techniques or policy-driven processes. These expand the basic conceptual discussion, but give the student a clearer picture of what systems engineering means in a real acquisition environment.},

These latter events all together can cause major disruptions to spacecraft that are in Earth's orbit and outside of the magnetosphere. In this work we are interested in establishing the necessary conditions for a major geo-effective solar particle storm immediately after a major flare, namely the existence of a direct magnetic connection. To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores not only the correlations of GOES X-ray and proton channels, but also the correlations that happen across all the proton channels. We found that proton channels autocorrelations and cross-correlations may also be precursors to the occurrence of an SEP event. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting {$>$}100 MeV SEP events from a multivariate time series perspective using easily interpretable decision tree models.},

Because it can be extremely  costly to modify them manually, a software tool for autonomous  reconfiguration of operational simulator behavior models is  proposed. To implement such a feature, behavior models must be  reassessed and reevaluated to identify the need of model updates  and to trigger them. This can be achieved by periodically  monitoring discrepancies between the satellite telemetry and the  simulator parameters. This paper describes a procedure for  comparative analysis between telemetry and simulation parameters  for an autonomous reconfiguration tool for operational simulator  behavior models for synchronization.},

It is essential to verify the quality of the compressed data and users' acceptability in terms of their remote sensing applications. Hyperspectral data cubes acquired by hyperspectral sensors such as casi, AVIRIS, Probe-1 and Hyperion were tested. Statistical hypothesis tests were used to assess if the means and variances in each spectral band of specified zones calculated from the reconstructed data cubes are significantly different from those calculated from the original data cube. Remote sensing end products, such as red edge, chlorophyll content and spectral unmixing were used to evaluate the compressed data. Preliminary test results show that hyperspectral data compressed using the two compression techniques at compression ratio up to 30:1 are acceptable in terms of statistical tests and remote sensing end products.},

Recently, the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary became a W3C recommendation and at the same time interesting datasets using it started to appear.

The Linked Data Visualisation Model is a formalism focused on this area and is implemented by Payola, a framework for analysis and visualization of Linked Data. In this paper, we present capabilities of LDVM and Payola to visualize RDF Data Cubes as well as other statistical datasets not yet compatible with the Data Cube Vocabulary. We also compare our approach to CubeViz, which is a visualization tool specialized on RDF Data Cube visualizations.},

The Integration and Test Laboratory (LIT) of the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE) is currently expanding its facilities due to the evolution of Brazilian space programs, which includes larger, complex, and heavier satellites, such as telecommunication satellites. One of the new test facilities that will be part of the LIT is an integrated CPTR and NFS facility for antenna and satellite payload testing. The systems engineering approach includes systems engineering processes, such as stakeholder needs and requirements definition, system concepts definition, system requirements definition, system analysis, and architecture definition. The approach also describes specific methods and tools that were implemented within each process, such as stakeholder interviews, life cycle analysis, context diagrams, and behavioral diagrams. Additionally, this paper presents a review of several existing compact test range and near-field facilities whose characteristics aided in the elaboration of the specifications. The systems engineering approach that was used enabled the establishment of an optimal solution for the combined CPTR and NFS facility that aligns with Brazilian space program projections.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to present the lessons learned in 20 years of application of the SCE (Systems Concurrent Engineering) approach that evolved over the last 20 years being applied to the development of more than 200 complex system solutions. SCE is an approach to the integrated development of complex systems that applies the systems engineering process, simultaneously, to the product elements of a system solution as well as for the service elements of the system solution, recursively, at every layer of the system solution breakdown structure. The approach was born as the application of the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes to the simultaneous development of a product, its life cycle processes and their performing organizations, at every layer of the product breakdown structure. The continuous application of the approach up to 2010, showed the need to include a stakeholder analysis step, to acknowledge that the solution was comprised of product and organization elements (processes were, in fact, the functions of products and organizations), that a mission layer should be added at the top of the product breakdown structure and that the notion of circumstances should be added to the traditional notion of scenarios. With the increasing use of the approach for system of systems conception and development such as those involving multi-spacecraft solutions, the mission layer needed to be extended to include other life cycle processes (besides the operations processes) concept of service and system service architecture. This requires the development of a system solution breakdown structure that will guide the development of the overall solution. For multi-spacecraft solutions, for example, it is necessary to conceive and architect testing, launching and decommissioning services as early as operations. Also, going into more detail in the approach, modes can be derived from circumstances, interface states and internal states of the system and not only from circumstances, as initially established in the approach. These lessons to be presented were learned during the development of: 1) the Brazilian Strategic Program for Space Systems (PESE) and; 2) the TIM Project (Telematics International Mission), a satellite formation with contributions from many regions in the world.},

The effort consists in developing a Brazilian CubeSat platform that can be industrialized in Brazil and takes advantage of a Systems Engineering Process approach. This Systems Engineering Process applied on the CubeSat includes mission and life-cycle analysis, requirements engineering, functional analysis, architecture design, and uses an operation life-cycle scenario as an example. The approach is supposed to be applied to every life-cycle process. Thus, System Engineering Process gives a wide range view of the problem, guiding engineers to develop product and organization solutions throughout life-cycle. This approach helps to solve technical and management issues that sometimes are not encompassed with just experienced staff and standard methods.},

  title = {User {{Behaviour Anomaly Detection}} in {{Multidimensional Data}}},
  abstract = {User Anomaly Detection, an important aspect of User Behaviour Analysis, is used to find anomalous user events from the event and network traffic log data. Traditional security mechanisms are not able to detect new/unknown types of anomalies as they do not incorporate contextual and behavioural aspects of the data for analysis. User Behaviour Anomaly Detection (UBAD) employs user behavioural patterns in context thereby achieving a higher detection rate. Log data employed for UBAD has multiple dimensions. With increase in dimensions (attributes), data gets sparse and the detection of anomalies becomes increasingly complex. For this reason, the single dimensional algorithms proposed for anomaly detection based on clustering, proximity and dimensional reduction do not work well on higher dimension data. OLAP based data analysis techniques provide efficient data slicing and aggregation operations crucial for multidimensional analytics along with multiscale visualisation for exploratory discovery. In this paper, an effective multidimensional process for UBAD is developed to detect anomalies using multi-dimensional statistical tests. An integral part of the process is the development of an OLAP Cube data model for event log data. The statistical efficiency of the UBAD process for different dimensions is investigated. On a real-life event log data, it is shown that the statistical efficiency of detection improves with the increased dimensionality of the tests: the true negative rate and the true positive rate show marked improvement. It is deduced that the computationally more expensive higher dimensional tests need to be employed in order to achieve better anomaly detection.},

  issn = {0306-4379},
  abstract = {The increasing availability of diverse multidimensional data on the web has led to the creation and adoption of common vocabularies and practices that facilitate sharing, aggregating and reusing data from remote origins. One prominent example in the Web of Data is the RDF Data Cube vocabulary, which has recently attracted great attention from the industrial, government and academic sectors as the de facto representational model for publishing open multidimensional data. As a result, different datasets share terms from common code lists and hierarchies, this way creating an implicit relatedness between independent sources. Identifying and analyzing relationships between disparate data sources is a major prerequisite for enabling traditional business analytics at the web scale. However, discovery of instance-level relationships between datasets becomes a computationally costly procedure, as typically all pairs of records must be compared. In this paper, we define three types of relationships between multidimensional observations, namely full containment, partial containment and complementarity, and we propose four methods for efficient and scalable computation of these relationships. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation over both real and synthetic datasets, comparing with traditional query-based and inference-based alternatives, and we show how our methods provide efficient and scalable solutions.},

The increasing volume and varying format of collected geospatial big data presents challenges in storing, managing, processing, analyzing, visualizing and verifying the quality of data. This has implications for the quality of decisions made with big data. Consequently, this position paper of the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Technical Commission II (TC II) revisits the existing geospatial data handling methods and theories to determine if they are still capable of handling emerging geospatial big data.

  abstract = {Massive, large-region coverage, multi-temporal, multi-spectral remote sensing (RS) datasets are employed widely due to the increasing requirements for accurate and up-to-date information about resources and the environment for regional and global monitoring. In general, RS data processing involves a complex multi-stage processing sequence, which comprises several independent processing steps according to the type of RS application. RS data processing for regional environmental and disaster monitoring is recognized as being computationally intensive and data intensive. We propose pipsCloud to address these issues in an efficient manner, which combines recent cloud computing and HPC techniques to obtain a large-scale RS data processing system that is suitable for on-demand real-time services. Due to the ubiquity, elasticity, and high-level transparency of the cloud computing model, massive RS data management and data processing for dynamic environmental monitoring can all be performed on the cloud via Web interfaces. A Hilbert-R+-based data indexing method is employed for the optimal querying and access of RS images, RS data products, and interim data. In the core platform beneath the cloud services, we provide a parallel file system for massive high-dimensional RS data, as well as interfaces for accessing irregular RS data to improve data locality and optimize the I/O performance. Moreover, we use an adaptive RS data analysis workflow management system for on-demand workflow construction and the collaborative processing of a distributed complex chain of RS data, e.g., for forest fire detection, mineral resources detection, and coastline monitoring. Our experimental analysis demonstrated the efficiency of the pipsCloud platform.},

In this paper, we describe the algorithms to build and query Hashedcubes, and how it can drive well-known interactive visualizations such as binned scatterplots, linked histograms and heatmaps. We report memory usage, build time and query latencies for a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that although sometimes Hashedcubes offers slightly slower querying times to the state of the art, the typical query is answered fast enough to easily sustain a interaction. In datasets with hundreds of millions of elements, only about 2\% of the queries take longer than 40ms. Finally, we discuss the limitations of data structure, potential spacetime tradeoffs, and future research directions.},

While such a concept of focused interaction is relevant to many domains besides OLAP explorations, like web search or interactive database exploration, there is currently no precise formal, commonly agreed definition. This concept of focus phase is drawn from Exploratory Search, which is a paradigm that theorized search as a complex interaction between a user and a system. The interaction consists of two different phases: an exploratory phase where the user is progressively defining her information need, and a focused phase where she investigates in details precise facts, and learn from this investigation. Following this model, our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to propose a formal feature-based description of a focused query in the context of interactive data exploration. Our experiments show that we manage to identify focused queries in real navigations, and that our model is sufficiently robust and general to be applied to different OLAP navigations datasets.},

This paper uses Nanjing, China as a case study and examines the possibility of using the data cube technique in data mining to understand space\textendash{}time travel patterns of Nanjing rail transit users. One month of smartcard data in October, 2013 was obtained from Nanjing rail transit system, with a total of over 22 million transaction records. We define the original data cube for the smartcard data based on four dimensions\textemdash{}Space, Date, Time, and User, design a hierarchy for each dimension, and use the total number of transactions as the quantitative measure. We develop modules using the programming language Python and share them as open-source on GitHub to enable peer production and advancement in the field. The visualizations of two-dimensional slices of the data cube show some interesting patterns such as different travel behaviors across user groups (e.g. students vs. elders), and irregular peak hours during National Holiday (October 1st\textendash{}7th) compared to regular morning and afternoon peak hours during regular working weeks. Spatially, multidimensional visualizations show concentrations of various activity opportunities near metro rail stations and the changing popularities of rail stations through time accordingly. These findings support the feasibility and efficiency of the data cube technique as a mean of visual exploratory analysis for massive smart-card data, and can contribute to the evaluation and planning of public transit systems.},

In this paper, we deal with the problem of data cube design and construction according to a user query where the expressed need is dispersed on more than one cube. We propose a cubes design and construction approach based on fusion of cubes containing a part of the user's need. We validate our approach via a tool, called ``Design-Cubes-Query'', that implements our approach and we show its use through a case study.},

  volume = {6585},
  abstract = {With hyperspectral pushbroom imaging spectrometers on Earth observation satellites it is possible to detect and identify dedicated ground pixels by their spectral signature. Conventional time consuming on-ground processing performs this selection by processing the measured hyperspectral data cube of the image. The Imaging Spectral Signature Instrument (ISSI) concept combines an optical on-board processing of the hyperspectral data cube with a thresholding algorithm, to identify pixels with a pre-defined and programmable spectral signature, such as water, forest and minerals, in the ground swath. The Imaging Spectral Signature Instrument consists of an imaging telescope, which images an object line on the entrance slit of a first imaging spectrometer, which disperses each pixel of the object line into its spectral content and images the hyperspectral image on the spatial light modulator. This spatial light modulator will be programmed with a spatial transmission or reflection behavior, which is constant along the spatial pixels and along the spectral pixels identical to a filter vector that corresponds to the spectral signature of the searched specific feature. A second inverted spectrometer reimages the by the first spectrometer dispersed and by the spatial light modulator transmitted or reflected flux into a line of pixels. In case the spectral content of the ground scene is identical to the searched signature, the flux traversing or reflecting the spatial light modulator will be maximum. The related pixel can be identified in the final image as a high signal by a threshold discriminator. A component test setup consists of an imaging lens, two Imspector\texttrademark{} spectrographs, a spatial light modulator, which is a programmable transmissible liquid crystal display and a CCD sensor as a detector. A mathematical model was developed for the instrument and its performance was evaluated in order to compare different concept variations. All components were measured and characterized individually, and the results were used in the simulations. Performance was then analyzed by means of radiometric throughput and spatial and spectral resolutions. The simulations were performed at wavelengths of 450 nm to 900 nm. The throughput was found to be between 1\% and 4.5\%.},

There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

  title = {Preparation of Analysis Ready Polsar Data for the {{Australian Geoscience Data Cube}}},
  abstract = {This paper describes a CSIRO investigation into the potential use of Sentinel-1 (S1) radar data with the Australian Geosciences Data Cube (AGDC) and in particular the necessity of polarimetric analysis of S1 dual-polarization data within AGDC. As a collaboration between Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and the National Computational Infrastructure, the AGDC provides a new collaborative information technology environment which combines an image database, high performance computing resources, software Application Programming Interfaces (API) to popular analysis tools and libraries, as well as an environment for custom algorithm development. It was created with the view to analysing the increasingly vast quantities of satellite imagery and other Earth observations. With the increasing availability of Earth observation data, especially freely accessed, globally covered and frequently revisited Copernicus Program data, the AGDC provides a potential resource for the analysis and processing of these data, especially where joint analysis with other archives is required. Here we investigate the preparation and necessity of including Sentinal-1 dual-pol SAR data polarimetric processing for the purpose of ingestion into the AGDC.},

Although advances in data mining technology have made extensive data collection much easier, it{\^a}s still always evolving and there is a constant need for new techniques and tools that can help us transform this data into useful information and knowledge. Since the previous edition{\^a}s publication, great advances have been made in the field of data mining. Not only does the third of edition of Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques continue the tradition of equipping you with an understanding and application of the theory and practice of discovering patterns hidden in large data sets, it also focuses on new, important topics in the field: data warehouses and data cube technology, mining stream, mining social networks, and mining spatial, multimedia and other complex data. Each chapter is a stand-alone guide to a critical topic, presenting proven algorithms and sound implementations ready to be used directly or with strategic modification against live data. This is the resource you need if you want to apply today{\^a}s most powerful data mining techniques to meet real business challenges. * Presents dozens of algorithms and implementation examples, all in pseudo-code and suitable for use in real-world, large-scale data mining projects. * Addresses advanced topics such as mining object-relational databases, spatial databases, multimedia databases, time-series databases, text databases, the World Wide Web, and applications in several fields. *Provides a comprehensive, practical look at the concepts and techniques you need to get the most out of your data},

  title = {Intelligent Analysis of Data Cube via Statistical Methods},
  abstract = {Data cube is a multi-dimensional structure of data representation used in data warehousing, which is analyzed using Online Analytical Process(OLAP). However, OLAP in itself is incapable of intelligent analysis in terms of generating a compact and useful data cube as well as lacks the power of predicting empty measures in data cube. Recently statistical methods have been applied for compact cube generation and prediction of empty measures in data cube. In this paper we reviewed and critically evaluated the available work done in this area. Literature review highlighted that sparsity, data redundancy and need of domain knowledge are problems in the way of intelligent analysis. Statistical methods have solved these issues in schema generation, compact cube generation and in prediction of empty measures of data cube individually. Methodology to solve these problems and then to perform an intelligent analysis has not yet been developed. In order to develop such an integrated methodology, we propose a conceptual model for intelligent analysis of data cube via statistical methods in the first stage. This model is integrating statistical methods used in generating a compact cube with a prediction mechanism. Our next target is to develop this model into a complete methodology.},

  abstract = {Recently, we configured RF antennas and a LWIR camera connected to an actuator system to form a collocated sensor system. We also developed a GUI which directly controls both RF and IR systems, azimuth motion, as well as performs post-processing for data integration and location finding. RF range data and LWIR images were collected simultaneously by using our configured sensor system as azimuth was varied from 0 to 70\&deg;. Series of collected RF data was transformed into a single 2-D radar image showing range profile of targets against azimuth. For LWIR, data was aligned into a single panoramic image as a function of azimuth by incorporating shift parameters observed in the measurements. Both RF/IR images were then arranged into a 3-D datacube, having azimuth as a common domain, and this datacube directly provided locational information of targets. For demonstration, we successfully located objects such as a corner reflector and a blackbody source under a dark background. In addition, we highlight some additional features available in our sensor system including target classification using both Euclidean and SVM based multi-classifier techniques, and tracking capability for region of interest on moving targets. Future work would be to improve the current system for outdoor measurement to locate distant targets.},

However powerful, the class of analyses these systems enable is somewhat limited: specifically, one can only quickly obtain plots such as histograms and heatmaps. In this paper, we contribute Gaussian Cubes, which significantly improves on state-of-the-art systems by providing interactive modeling capabilities, which include but are not limited to linear least squares and principal components analysis (PCA). The fundamental insight in Gaussian Cubes is that instead of precomputing counts of many data subsets (as state-of-the-art systems do), Gaussian Cubes precomputes the best multivariate Gaussian for the respective data subsets. As an example, Gaussian Cubes can fit hundreds of models over millions of data points in well under a second, enabling novel types of visual exploration of such large datasets. We present three case studies that highlight the visualization and analysis capabilities in Gaussian Cubes, using earthquake safety simulations, astronomical catalogs, and transportation statistics. The dataset sizes range around one hundred million elements and 5 to 10 dimensions. We present extensive performance results, a discussion of the limitations in Gaussian Cubes, and future research directions.},

  shorttitle = {Privacy-Preserving Data Cube for Electronic Medical Records},
  abstract = {Introduction
: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of privacy-preserving data cubes of electronic medical records (EMRs). An EMR data cube is a complex of EMR statistics that are summarized or aggregated by all possible combinations of attributes. Data cubes are widely utilized for efficient big data analysis and also have great potential for EMR analysis. For safe data analysis without privacy breaches, we must consider the privacy preservation characteristics of the EMR data cube. In this paper, we introduce a design for a privacy-preserving EMR data cube and the anonymization methods needed to achieve data privacy. We further focus on changes in efficiency and effectiveness that are caused by the anonymization process for privacy preservation. Thus, we experimentally evaluate various types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes using several practical metrics and discuss the applicability of each anonymization method with consideration for the EMR analysis environment.
Methods
: We construct privacy-preserving EMR data cubes from anonymized EMR datasets. A real EMR dataset and demographic dataset are used for the evaluation. There are a large number of anonymization methods to preserve EMR privacy, and the methods are classified into three categories (i.e., global generalization, local generalization, and bucketization) by anonymization rules. According to this classification, three types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes were constructed for the evaluation. We perform a comparative analysis by measuring the data size, cell overlap, and information loss of the EMR data cubes.
Results
: Global generalization considerably reduced the size of the EMR data cube and did not cause the data cube cells to overlap, but incurred a large amount of information loss. Local generalization maintained the data size and generated only moderate information loss, but there were cell overlaps that could decrease the search performance. Bucketization did not cause cells to overlap and generated little information loss; however, the method considerably inflated the size of the EMR data cubes.
Conclusions
: The utility of anonymized EMR data cubes varies widely according to the anonymization method, and the applicability of the anonymization method depends on the features of the EMR analysis environment. The findings help to adopt the optimal anonymization method considering the EMR analysis environment and goal of the EMR analysis.},

The challenge is not only to store and manage the vast volume of data (``big data''), but also to analyze and extract meaningful value from it. There are several approaches to collecting, storing, processing, and analyzing big data. The main focus of the paper is on unstructured data analysis. Unstructured data refers to information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or does not fit well into relational tables. Unstructured data is the fastest growing type of data, some example could be imagery, sensors, telemetry, video, documents, log files, and email data files. There are several techniques to address this problem space of unstructured analytics. The techniques share a common characteristics of scale-out, elasticity and high availability. MapReduce, in conjunction with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and HBase database, as part of the Apache Hadoop project is a modern approach to analyze unstructured data. Hadoop clusters are an effective means of processing massive volumes of data, and can be improved with the right architectural approach.},

For example, on the task of detecting so-called Kepler objects of interest (KOIs), a range of different `off the shelf' classifiers has demonstrated outstanding performance. These rather preliminary research efforts motivate further exploration of this data domain. In the present work we focus on the analysis of threshold crossing events (TCEs) extracted from photometric data acquired by the Kepler spacecraft. We show that the task of classifying TCEs as being effected by actual planetary transits as opposed to confounding astrophysical phenomena is significantly more challenging than that of KOI detection, with different classifiers exhibiting vastly different performances. Nevertheless, the best performing classifier type, the random forest, achieved excellent accuracy, correctly predicting in approximately 96\% of the cases. Our results and analysis should illuminate further efforts into the development of more sophisticated, automatic techniques, and encourage additional work in the area.},

Transmission of tones or PN sequences drain power and bandwidth that could be better used for transmitting additional science data from the spacecraft.

In this paper, the structure of the maximum likelihood estimator for range and Doppler is derived, and its performance determined relative to Crame{\^A}\textquestiondown{}r-Rao bounds via simulation and analysis. Performance of conventional Doppler and delay estimators based on carrier tracking loops is also derived, and contrasted with the performance of the optimum Doppler-delay estimator over a range of symbol SNR typically encountered in deep-space applications.},

This search for improvement has led to a significant movement to advance mission operations monitoring tools. Anomaly detection is an important field for the anticipation of spacecraft operations, working as an enabler of diagnostic and prognostic functions. This article discusses a new real application of a well-known data driven statistical software known as soft independent modeling for class analogy (SIMCA-P) developed by Umetrics to historical telemetry for attitude determination and control system (ADCS) of actual remote sensing spacecraft. Our design work is to detect anomalies from mission control center (MCC) through analyzing the telemetry readings received by MCC and respond to ADCS off-nominal situations by sending corrective actions tele-commands within real time to avoid critical and risky situations. We have implemented our approach on the engineering model of Egyptian satellite project Egypt-Sat1 and this model was our vehicle to simulate and verify the results. In conclusion, the analysis results provide a deep insight information and physical interpretation about the ADCS performance behavior.},

  volume = {2},
  abstract = {A new approach to mission operations has been flight validated on NASA's Deep Space One (DS1) mission that launched in October 1998. The beacon monitor operations technology is aimed at decreasing the total volume of downlinked engineering telemetry by reducing the frequency of downlink and the volume of data received per pass. Cost savings are achieved by reducing the amount of routine telemetry processing and analysis performed by ground staff. With beacon monitoring, the spacecraft will assess its own health and will transmit one of four subcarrier frequency tones to inform the ground how urgent it is to track the spacecraft for telemetry. If all conditions are nominal, the tone provides periodic assurance to ground personnel that the mission is proceeding as planned without having to receive and analyze downlinked telemetry. If there is a problem, the tone will indicate that tracking is required and the resulting telemetry will contain a concise summary of what has occurred since the last telemetry pass. The beacon technology has been proven successful on DS1 through a series of tone tests and data summarization experiments. This collection of experiments was called the DS1 Beacon Monitor Experiment or BMOX. There are important lessons still to be learned from this experiment that can be applied to future spacecraft missions},

  abstract = {The Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the first of NASA's Great Observatories, was launched on April 24, 1990. The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals. Major changes to the HST ground system are planned to be in place for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called 'vision December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system re-engineering effort, a project called 'vision 2000 control center systems (CCS)', are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's lifetime. Development costs will be reduced by providing a modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial of f the shelf (COTS) products wherever possible. Operating costs will be reduced by eliminating redundant legacy systems and processes and by providing an integrated ground system geared toward autonomous operation. Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for all HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will include a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform- independent from an office environment using commercial standards. Latest internet technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives. This paper will provide a high level overview of the CCS system and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities. Samples of CCS user interface pages will be given. Vision 2000 is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way. It will allow the HST program to realize reduced operations costs for the Third Servicing Mission and beyond.},

  title = {State-of-Health Analysis Applied to Spacecraft Telemetry Based on a New Projection to Latent Structure Discriminant Analysis Algorithm},
  abstract = {The potential for space mission operations and the supporting ground infrastructure is growing dramatically, fueled by new technologies, but with that growth comes increased complexity, and daunting reliability and security challenges. And like most complex endeavors, space operations are being asked to do more with less. In order to deliver cost-effective space operations services, researchers must explore novel ways to build and operate systems under study. Innovation is the engine that drives progress in today's high-tech global economy. Statistical multivariate latent techniques are one of the vital learning tools that are used to tackle the aforementioned problem coherently. There has been a tremendous increase in the volume of telemetry data over the last decade from contemporary spacecrafts. All these datasets need to be analyzed for finding interesting patterns or for searching for both moderate and significant outliers. Information extraction from such rich data sources using advanced statistical methodologies is a challenging task due to the massive volume of data. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel supervised learning algorithm based on projection to latent structure discriminant analysis technique (PLS-DA). The algorithm is particularly uses to model, analyze, classify telemetry data and identify key contributors to anomalous events while simultaneously measuring several predictors and response variables. The performance of the algorithm using the telemetry acquired from of attitude determination and control system (ADCS) of actual remote sensing spacecraft was presented. In addition, a critical compression between the analysis results obtained by the algorithm and the multivariate statistical analysis software Simca-P developed by Umetrics was presented. Finally, the algorithm provides competent information in modelling, classifying, diagnosis and prediction as well as adding more insight and physical interpretation to the ADCS s- ate of health (SOH).},

  title = {Design of Command, Data and Telemetry Handling System for a Distributed Computing Architecture {{CubeSat}}},
  abstract = {Among the size, weight and power constraints imposed by the CubeSat specification, the limitation associated with power can be addressed through a distributed computing architecture. This paper describes such a distributed computing architecture and its operational design in the form of command and data handling system and telemetry formulation, adapted for a CubeSat whose power requirements for proving the mission are significantly larger than the on-orbit average power generated. The 1U CubeSat with the mission objective of precision three axes attitude control is composed of a low power flight computer and a high power, high speed auxiliary processor (CMG controller), along with a high capacity battery. The precision sensors, actuators and complex computing algorithms, are interfaced and implemented on the high speed auxiliary processor, which is operated intermittently. Health monitoring sensors, transceiver and other housekeeping tasks are interfaced and implemented on the flight computer, which is in continuous operation. To facilitate effective operation and telemetry packaging, each computing unit is designed to host a storage device. The flight software, designed as operating modes, is distributed across the two computing platforms. Distributed operations are initiated through the flight computer and executed on the auxiliary processor. The paper describes in detail the distributed design of these operating modes as flowcharts and the associated telemetry budget as tables.},

  title = {A Novel Scheme for Telemetry System Data Rate Optimization},
  abstract = {Limited telemetry bandwidth due to restricted radio frequency spectrum allocation is typically one of the most challenging problems when designing a telemetry system for space applications. To further complicate the problem, a large percentage of the allotted bandwidth is consumed by the over-head required by each packet to follow various standards and layer of protocols used in the telemetry system. This results in inefficiency in the actual telemetry data downlinked to the ground station. In the typical telemetry design, only one virtual channel is used per packet. As a result, in order to achieve the required packet size, filled data is inserted into the remaining bits. This Idle Packet consists of a set pattern of binary digits, and is considered part of the overhead, as its sole purpose is to fill the packet. In this work, a new scheme is proposed which takes advantage of the empty bits by starting the next virtual channel instead of inserting filled bits. This method will reduce the overall amount of overheard, in addition to allowing more data to be transmitted.},

  title = {Using Telemetry to Measure Equipment Usable Life on the {{NASA Orion}} Spacecraft},
  abstract = {The NASA Orion manned spacecraft will replace the NASA Space Shuttle for getting astronauts to low earth orbit, moon and Mars and returned to the earth safely. It also serves as a crew escape vehicle at the ISS to increase astronaut safety The NASA integrated, vehicle health management (IVHM) program has been adopted by many segments of the aerospace industry. The IVHM is the tool to prevent catastrophic failures by identifying the equipment that will fail prematurely for replacement, thus preventing/eliminating surprise equipment failures from threatening both safety and mission success. Due to the extreme environments experienced by both the launch vehicle and its payload (s) during launch and while operating in space the space industry often rejects most advancements made in other aerospace industries in technology related to and improving reliability. Personnel on the ground responsible for launch vehicle and spacecraft receive limited technical information from an on-board telemetry system that generates routes engineering data, whose accuracy is suspect, available from spacecraft when both planned and unplanned events occur. Included in this paper are examples of spacecraft equipment failures that have been accurately predicted to occur or prevented from occurring. We provide many examples of equipment telemetry measurements used to measure spacecraft equipment usable life. The equipment with a measured usable will fail prematurely with certainty. The equipment that will fail prematurely should be replaced at the factory or if the spacecraft is in space, the failure can be managed to a positive conclusion. This paper summarizes the use of a prognostic and health management program including using predictive algorithms to measure equipment life and predict remaining usable life with certainty on the many NASA space missions as specified in the NASA IVHM technical plan published in 2009. The non-Markov reliability paradigm for measuring equipment usable life wa- specifically developed for preventing surprise catastrophic equipment failures. It is already in use on the Air Force F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The decision to use a PHM is in part, based on the results from our prognostic analysis we completed on the NASA GSFC Extreme Ultra Violet Explorer LEO space science satellite and the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia accidents. Our results identified the information that was present but was ignored for a variety of reasons that would have prevented both Space Shuttle accidents if the information had been properly interpreted.},

  issn = {0929-6212, 1572-834X},
  abstract = {Hydro-, Aeolian and Solar energy show significant promise in helping to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases, which is a primary focus in today's sustainable development culture. To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy.},

The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The cube treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. Aggregation points are represented by an "infinite value", ALL, so the point (ALL,ALL,...,ALL, sum(*)) represents the global sum of all items. Each ALL value actually represents the set of values contributing to that aggregation.},

In this paper, we focus on an approximate nearest neighbor search for two different types of queries: r-Range search and k-NN search. Adapting a novel concept of a ring structure, we define a new index structure MLR-Index (Multi-Layer Ring-based Index) in a metric space and propose time and space efficient algorithms with high accuracy. Evaluations through comprehensive experiments comparing with the bestknown high-dimensional indexing method LSH show that our approach is faster for a similar accuracy, and shows higher accuracy for a similar response time than LSH.},

  title = {Using Analog Telemetry to Measure Spacecraft Equipment Usable Life Upgrading Factory {{ATP}}},
  abstract = {When probability reliability analysis engineering was adopted in 1960 by the U.S. government, it became required use by spacecraft and launch vehicle suppliers to quantify spacecraft and launch vehicle reliability in probabilistic terms. Due to its use, spacecraft and launch vehicle suppliers stopped looking for the cause of premature equipment failures that was plaguing the industry. The government procurement contracts did not financially penalize space vehicle suppliers when their equipment failed prematurely, but did financially penalize them for a late delivery, increasing the motivation for space vehicle suppliers to overlook and misdiagnose equipment behavior in the test data that slowed down testing and increased risk of earning a financial penalty for a late delivery. The risk of a premature failure is so high that NASA GSFC pays for NOAA's long-life weather satellites after they get to space and function properly for at least one year. Military satellites fail prematurely so often that in 2010, the Air Force Space and Missiles Systems Center fined an Air Force space vehicle supplier \$15M for the premature failure of the apogee engine of the AEHF-1 satellite. The private space companies that own satellites and earn income selling the satellite services anticipate the premature failure of either their launch vehicle or satellite and purchase space insurance policies that cost up to \$60M to pay for all the financial losses that occur when their satellites and launch vehicles fail prematurely. To minimize the public from learning about the frequency that space vehicle equipment purchased by NASA and the military, fails prematurely, the information is proprietary to the company that produced it. The government agency's that purchase space vehicle equipment that fails prematurely do not want it to be known publically either and so the financial losses due to the premature failure of NASA and military satellites to the taxpayer is difficult to ascertain but is- identified by some sources as ranging from \$4B to \$10B per year. To stop the premature failure of space vehicle equipment, spacecraft equipment usable life can be measured using the same equipment telemetry data generated and used to measure and confirm equipment performance. Predictive algorithms use equipment analog telemetry to identify non-repeatable transient behavior in equipment telemetry related to equipment end-of-life. This paper will explain the technology, tools necessary to identify the space vehicle equipment that will fail prematurely from parts will accelerated aging in the space and ground segment environment with the presence of noise from a variety of sources.},

The ecological alterations, essentially caused by anthropogenic factors, are the main cause of many transformations such as the ecosystem changes, coastal erosion or pollution that affects water quality. The purpose of this paper is to present the environmental measurements performed with ground telemetry systems near the Black Sea coast in the Danube Delta and the fusion of sensor data with datasets from EO satellite applications. We present the BEIA telemetry system that has been installed and is further being developed for the National Administration ``Romanian Waters'' (ANAR), an automatic system able to continuously monitor the level and water temperature along the Danube, Danube Delta and some of its tributary rivers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how big data processing software can be used for extracting non-trivial correlations from telemetry and EO data. This paper is a general overview of the results for telemetry and EO integration in the Black Sea and the Danube region and could support ESA (European Space Agency) in defining future investments in EO research and development activities to foster EO innovation in the region.},

  volume = {4844},
  abstract = {A major milestone in an effort to update the aging Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ground system was completed when HST operations were switched to a new ground system, a project called "Vision 2000 Control Center System CCS)", at the time of the third Servicing Mission in December 1999. A major CCS subsystem is the Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on modern Data Warehousing technology. In fact, the Data Warehouse (DW) as implemented in the CCS Ground System that operates and monitors the Hubble Space Telescope represents, the first use of a commercial Data Warehouse to manage engineering data. By the end of February 2002, the process of populating the Data Warehouse with HST historical telemetry data had been completed, providing access to HST engineering data for a period of over 12 years with a current data volume of 2.8 Terabytes. This paper describes hands-on experience from an end user perspective, using the CCS system capabilities, including the Data Warehouse as an HST engineering telemetry archive. The Engineering Team at the Space Telescope Science Institute is using HST telemetry extensively for monitoring the Scientific Instruments, in particular for {$\cdot$} Spacecraft anomaly resolutions {$\cdot$} Scientific Instrument trending {$\cdot$} Improvements of Instrument operational efficiency The overall idea is to maximize science output of the space observatory. Furthermore, the CCS provides a powerful feature to build, save, and recall real-time display pages customized to specific subsystems and operational scenarios. Engineering teams are using the real-time monitoring capabilities intensively during Servicing Missions and real time commanding to handle anomaly situations, while the Flight Operations Team (FOT) monitors the spacecraft around the clock.},

  abstract = {The correlation analysis of telemetry data plays a significant role in satellite performance analysis. However, the existing methods cannot be well applied, because the telemetry data is large and high-dimensional. In this paper, an efficient algorithm named QARC Apriori is proposed. First, to reduce the redundant attributes and lower the problem complexity, grey relational analysis method is applied. Second, each filtered attribute is partitioned into several subintervals, combining with K-Means clustering algorithm. During clustering, the outliers are removed to improve the accuracy of clustering results. Due to different distributions and scopes of attributes, the clustering centers are automatically adjusted. Moreover, the statistical information of each attribute is used to avoid repeatedly scanning database. Finally, all quantitative association rules are mined by an improved Apriori algorithm. In order to improve the mining efficiency, two pruning strategies are used. The experiments are conducted with the power supply data of a China's satellite from 2011.6.1 to 2011.9.1. It indicates that the proposed algorithm is suitable for quantitative association rules mining and is important for satellite on-orbit performance analysis.},

  abstract = {The Maunder minimum (MM) was a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715. In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480 year period spanning AD 1440\textendash{}1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.},

  title = {Intelligent Data Cube Construction and Exploration},
  abstract = {Data cubes are multi-dimensional structures that consist of dimensions and measures. Analysts can view the performance measures via different perspectives provided by the available dimensions in data cubes. However, modeling of these meaningful dimensions and selection of informative measure is a difficult task for human data warehouse developers. In high dimensional environments, the sheer size and volume of data poses a number of challenges in order to generate meaningful data cubes. Nowadays, there is a growing requirement of automated and intelligent techniques that allows analysts to construct and explore the large cubes for better decision making. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature on intelligent data cubes construction and exploration. Literature review reveals that a number of techniques have been proposed to embed intelligence in data cubes. However, majority of the previously proposed technique targeted either on providing intelligence in cube construction or focused assisting the intelligent exploration of data cubes. However, there is very limited amount of work has been done in the integration of intelligent techniques for both cube construction and exploration. We believe that it is a strong area of research and the modern analytical systems demand the availability of intelligent techniques for both construction and exploration of large data cubes for making intelligent decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a critical review of the existing techniques and to propose a conceptual model that not only overcomes the individual limitations in the previous work but also merges the benefits of intelligent construction and exploration of cubes in parallel. However, the implementation of the proposed model is beyond the scope of this paper.},

Transforming statistical Linked Data into a star schema to populate a relational database and applying a common OLAP engine do not allow to optimise OLAP queries on RDF or to directly propagate changes of Linked Data sources to clients. Therefore, as a new way to interact with statistics published as Linked Data, we investigate the problem of executing OLAP queries via SPARQL on an RDF store. First, we define projection, slice, dice and roll-up operations on single data cubes published as Linked Data reusing the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and show how a nested set of operations lead to an OLAP query. Second, we show how to transform an OLAP query to a SPARQL query which generates all required tuples from the data cube. In a small experiment, we show the applicability of our OLAP-to-SPARQL mapping in answering a business question in the financial domain.},

  shorttitle = {Mining Satellite Telemetry Data},
  abstract = {An artificial Satellite's health and functioning in space is monitored by analysing the stream of Telemetry Data received at the Satellite Ground Control Centre. This data is received continually during the entire mission life of the Satellite. Hence a huge volume of Data is collected for any given satellite. Data Mining techniques are now regularly applied to analyse such large quantity of data for outlier analysis, fault detection in past data and fault prediction. In the present work, hidden relationships between apparently unrelated Telemetry parameters are mined by applying Rule Induction and Association Rule mining algorithms separately on a data set with randomly selected parameters. From the results obtained, a comparison is made to assess the suitability of either of these techniques to the application domain. This paper presents a finding that Rule Mining Algorithm is most appropriate for the domain application since Association rule mining is not amenable to data sets of Satellite Telemetry Parameters which are highly unrelated but whose functional inter-relationships during specified on-orbit stages are to be mined.},

  title = {Analysis of Satellite Telemetry Data},
  volume = {4},
  abstract = {Satellites transmit data streams to the ground that consist of data values, called mnemonics, that are used to determine the health and location of the satellite. These data streams can contain between 700 and 12000 or more mnemonics. These mnemonics must be analyzed to ensure that the satellite is healthy, to assist in resolving any anomalies, and to determine if there are any trends that would indicate a possible future problem. Satellite engineers need assistance to assimilate and act on these large volumes of data. The USAF Phillips Laboratory Space System Technologies Division (PL/VTS) has developed a telemetry analysis system called the Visual Interface for Satellite Telemetry Analysis (VISTA) that captures and displays satellite telemetry data in real time and provides tools for analyzing stored data. An important aspect of VISTA is the analysis of stored telemetry data. The satellite engineer needs quick, accurate access to the stored satellite data in numerous forms, such as plots, reports; curve fitting, and Fourier analysis graphs. The challenge was to develop a telemetry analysis system that was flexible, fast, accurate, and able to provide the multiple views of the data required by the satellite engineers. This paper provides an overview of VISTA, and then discusses how the telemetry analysis tool (TAT) was developed, how the system functions, timing information, and future work},

Especially, effective anomaly detection, based on telemetry data, plays an important role for the system health management of a spacecraft. With the advantages of easy-to-use, high efficiency, and data-driven, the predicted model has been applied for anomalous point detection for monitoring data. However, compared with the point abnormal mode, fragment anomaly is more attractive and meaningful for the system identification. Therefore, the detection strategy of fragment anomaly is proposed based on the uncertainty estimation of least square support vector machine and statistical analysis. Moreover, some effective estimation indicators are presented to evaluate the performance of the detection method. Experimental validations are also carried out for some typical simulation data sets and open source data sets. In particular, relied on the analysis of fragment anomaly modes, experiments are conducted with the real satellite telemetry data and different anomaly modes are injected to examine the applicability of the proposed framework.},

The current work has been built upon the previous experience of the development of a similar tool for the planning of the observations of another ESA mission, the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). Although tailored for specific XMM's requirements, XMAS is for this reason capable of dealing with modeling features, constraints and objectives common to both missions and may therefore be regarded as a more generic tool, covering many aspects of the scheduling problems for single-instrument space observatories. After a brief introduction on APSI study, the paper focuses on the peculiarities of XMM-Newton observations features and on the performance indexes, constraints and heuristics that have been necessary to deal with the given requirements. Results will then be presented according to two test sets, representative of typical XMM's LTP problems, and some conclusions and possible improvements will finally be outlined.},

  abstract = {Data mining is a difficult task that relies on an exploratory and analytic process of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules. It requires complex methodologies, and the increasing heterogeneity and complexity of available data requires some skills to build the data mining processes, or knowledge flows. The goal of this work is to describe data-mining processes in terms of Automated Planning, which will allow us to automatize the data-mining knowledge flow construction. The work is based on the use of standards both in data mining and automated-planning communities. We use PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) to describe data mining tasks. From the PMML, a problem description in PDDL can be generated, so any current planning system can be used to generate a plan. This plan is, again, translated to a KFML format (Knowledge Flow file for the WEKA tool), so the plan or data-mining workflow can be executed in WEKA. In this manuscript we describe the languages, how the translation from PMML to PDDL, and from a plan to KFML are performed, and the complete architecture of our system.},

We propose a new discovery-driven exploration paradigm that mines the data for such exceptions and summarizes the exceptions at appropriate levels in advance. It then uses these exceptions to lead the analyst to interesting regions of the cube during navigation. We present the statistical foundation underlying our approach.

Theoretical analysis shows that the control law can actuate the fleet to the desired configuration. Moreover, the collision avoidance between the members is also considered in the process from initial configuration to pre-assembly configuration. Finally, a numerical example is presented to verify the feasibility of proposed mission planning and the effectiveness of control law.},

  abstract = {Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as simply AI Planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory.
In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages.},

  abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently.},

A new planning modeling language was created, which allows a description of the operations domain closer to the real system and with few abstractions.

  title = {Learning with {{Opponent}}-{{Learning Awareness}}},
  abstract = {Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. Beyond a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks and decentralized optimization can all be seen as instances of this setting. However, the presence of multiple learning agents in these settings renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method that reasons about the anticipated learning of the other agents. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts for the impact of the agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. We show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the likelihood ratio policy gradient update, making the method suitable for model-free RL. This method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. Preliminary results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD), while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to infinitely repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents can successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using deep recurrent policies. Again, by considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of selfish interests.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs. We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques. DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3\%.},

Especially we utilize our Linux-based ARINC-653, which can provide abundant development tools, software libraries, and device drivers due to the nature of Linux. Our control and mission software include Operational Flight Program (OFP), Video Streaming Program (VSP), Ground Control Program (GCP), and Ground Monitoring Program (GMP). We test our programs in a HILS environment and show that these run correctly in terms of functionality and real-time requirements.

But from experience in different projects, when these analyses are performed at the software level, they are not used to their maximum extent: they are always late and their content is often incomplete (just to justify the already assigned criticality level). They are not always considered as bringing safety and dependability requirements into the project. Existing techniques may be used along all software development and used for many different purposes to support the definition, verification and demonstration of software related safety and dependability characteristics. Therefore the questions are: When are these analyses required? Why are they so difficult to be performed? How are they finally used and why in such a limited way so far? This paper will analyze when these analyses are required, what for, which ones are required by ECSS and evaluate how to better use them in Space projects.},

  abstract = {The capability of discriminating radar targets exhibiting multiple moving parts has become of great interest for both aerospace and ground-based target recognition and analysis. In particular, helicopters and other targets with rotors, as for instance miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, exhibit peculiar characteristics in the radar return that can be used for their recognition. In this paper a novel algorithm to address the problem of micro-Doppler signature unmixing is proposed, exploiting the signal separation capabilities of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The core of the algorithm is represented precisely by the use of the ICA procedure, that has been already proved to be a very effective technique for separating hidden information in mixtures of observations. ICA has been successfully employed in several applications such as wireless communications, radar beamforming, trace-gases unmixing and medical imaging processing. The helicopter's rotor blade signature unmixing from a multi-static radar system is considered as case study and results obtained through the application of ICA to simulated multi-component micro-Doppler signatures show the capability of the proposed approach to successfully accomplish the unmixing operation.},

  title = {A Survey of Calibration Algorithms for Small Satellite Magnetometers},
  abstract = {Magnetometers are an integral part of attitude determination system for the low-Earth orbiting small satellites as they are lightweight, inexpensive and reliable. Yet using magnetometers for attitude determination is not straightforward because of the sensor errors. These errors limit the overall achievable attitude determination accuracy. Thus far different methods to cope with magnetometer errors and calibrate the magnetometers have been proposed. A new research field is the specific errors for magnetometers onboard the small satellites and their time-variation characteristics. In accordance, algorithms which consider also the time-varying error terms are proposed. This paper reviews the recent calibration algorithms for small satellite magnetometers. The survey mainly covers batch and recursive estimation algorithms which are capable of estimating the time-varying magnetometer error terms. It presents the foundation of each algorithm and covers issues about the algorithm design, application and performance. In the end possible directions in this research field are briefly discussed.},

  title = {Obstacle Detection and Ranging Sensor Integration for a Small Unmanned Aircraft System},
  abstract = {In the last few years, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have been attracting enormous research interest, being employed in military and civilian missions (e.g. search and rescue, disaster assessment, urban traffic monitoring, 3D mapping, etc.) that would be risky or impossible for a human to perform. For autonomous or aided operations (e.g. automatic or aided landing), it is crucial to have on board an effective suite of sensors allowing navigation in unknown environments. This work performs obstacle detection and attitude estimation for a small quad-rotor by using low-cost sensors, namely, a Sonic Ranging Sensor (SRS) and an InfraRed Sensor (IRS), widely used in mobile applications for short distance measurements. Both sensors were controlled and managed by a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560) and synchronized at 2-Hz sampling. Attitude estimation was performed using multiple distance measurements between a solid surface (e.g. wall or ground) and the SRS/IRS sensors. A short range of 20-150 cm has been considered in order to assist the UAS landing procedure. The main objective was to integrate the SRS and IRS measurements for accurate distance and attitude estimation by means of variance minimization. Simulations and experimental results show the feasibility of low-cost sensor fusion for obstacle detection and ranging applications on a small rotary wing UAS.},

  abstract = {Over the last years, nanosatellites based on the CubeSat standard have been increasingly exploited by both academic institutions and commercial companies. The low cost and short development time of CubeSats make such miniature spacecraft interesting for a variety of applications. A particularly appealing future field of application for nanosatellites is On-Orbit Servicing of existing orbital assets. A number of mission concepts foresee the employment of miniature spacecraft to perform a variety of operations on orbital vehicles, ranging from inspection and monitoring to assembly and repairing. In this framework, the development of technologies that enable proximity navigation and/or docking between a nanosatellite chaser and a target object is of interest. In particular, miniaturized navigation sensors for the estimation of relative position and attitude of the involved vehicles are required. The work presented here focuses on the development of an IR-based relative navigation sensor compatible with CubeSat standard nanosatellites. The system estimates the relative pose and position of the target by taking images of the object, which is equipped with retro-reflecting fiducial markers illuminated by an array of IR LEDs on the chaser. The system architecture and operation are described, and preliminary laboratory test results are presented.},

This application is part of a satellite ground station that processes sensor data from payloads and monitors the SOH of the ground station itself. The first payload of the constellation was launched in 2001. The PSOH application was used successfully for Early Orbit Turn-on (EOT) testing, and it is currently processing data autonomously. The PSOH application was developed with three types of users in mind. It accommodates the needs of payload designers who predominately use it during EOT. It uses a highly intuitive graphical Human Computer Interface (HCI) that allows a non-expert ground station operator to monitor all payloads of the constellation with a minimal chance of human error. It generates messages that provide a persistent record of any anomalies for use by the sensor data analyst. This paper shows how early development of the ground station PSOH application can benefit the three main users the sensor designer, the operator, and the data analyst.},

The feasibility of a 100-year lifespan space mission is taken as the guiding thread for the discussion. Such a mission, defined with a few preliminary requirements, could be used to deliver messages to our descendants regardless of the on-ground contingencies. After the analysis of the main threats for long endurance in space, including radiation, debris and micrometeoroids, atmospheric drag and thermal environment, the available solutions are investigated. A trade-off study analyses orbital profiles from the point of view of radiation, thermal stability and decay rate, providing best locations to maximize lifespan. Special attention is also paid to on-board power, in terms of energy harvesting and accumulation, highlighting the limitations of current assets, i.e. solar panels and batteries, and revealing possible future solutions. Furthermore, the review includes electronics, non-volatile memories and communication elements, which need extra hardening against radiation and thermal cycling if extra-long endurance is required. As a result of the analysis, a century-lifetime mission is depicted by putting together all the reviewed concepts. The satellite, equipped with reliability enhanced elements and system-level solutions such as smart hibernation policies, could provide limited but still useful performance after a 100-year flight.},

The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed an innovative Mission Operations Center (MOC) designed to accommodate the constellation's significant planning and data downlink requirements [2]. The large number of data downlink opportunities necessitates a MOC that can easily identify and schedule ground contacts, and autonomously run the ground contact events from initiation of acquisition to delivery of the L0 science data.

  abstract = {In recent years, commercial exploitation of small satellites and CubeSats has rapidly increased. Time to market of processed customer data products is becoming an important differentiator between solution providers and satellite constellation operators. Timely and accurate data dissemination is the key to success in the commercial usage of small satellite constellations which is ultimately dependent on a high degree of autonomous fleet management and automated decision support. The traditional way for disseminating data is limited by on the communication capability of the satellite and the ground terminal availability. Even though cloud computing solutions on the ground offer high analytical performance, getting the data from the space infrastructure to the ground servers poses a bottleneck of data analysis and distribution. On the other hand, adopting advanced and intelligent algorithms onboard offers the ability of autonomy, tasking of operations, and fast customer generation of low latency conclusions, or even real-time communication with assets on the ground or other sensors in a multi-sensor configuration. In this paper, the advantages of intelligent onboard processing using advanced algorithms for Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) compliant onboard data processing systems are explored. The onboard data processing architecture is designed to handle a large amount of high-speed streaming data and provides hardware redundancy to be qualified for the space mission application domain. We conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance analysis by using image recognition algorithms based on an open source intelligent machine library ``MIOpen'' and an open standard ``OpenVX''. OpenVX is a cross-platform computer vision library.},

  shorttitle = {Validation of Ground Technologies for Future {{Q}}/{{V}} Band Satellite Systems},
  abstract = {With the aim of supporting satellite Terabit connectivity, the future generations of High Throughput Systems - HTS rely on the exploitation of Q/V band frequencies. These frequency bands offer the possibility to have larger bandwidth availability with respect to Ka-band systems, freeing the portion of the Ka frequency band that is currently allocated to feeder links and offering bigger portion of spectrum for specific services, such as the aeronautical in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) services. The design of a Ground Segment for Q/V band satellite communications presents however several technological challenges. The design of antennas, power amplifiers with high efficiency and Low Noise receivers are critical, nevertheless they are fundamental to support high data rate transmissions. Furthermore, to counteract atmospheric impairments, a system able to implement and manage a handover mechanism between gateways is also needed. A Ground Segment for Q/V band high throughput system has been conceived in the project ``Q/V band earth segment LInk for Future high Throughput space systems'' (QV-LIFT), funded by the European Commission in the framework of the Horizon 2020 program. The consolidation of crucial technologies for new generation satellite communications is addressed, with the objective to ensure space accessibility to Europe and, in particular, to foster technology readiness of European industries in space related sectors. This paper provides the description of key hardware and software developments for next generation HTS systems operating in Q/V band, based on core technologies for both ground and user segments currently under development for the QV-LIFT project. The system test architecture which will be used to validate the developed technology and functionalities is also presented, together with the overview of the project status and validation plan.},

  shorttitle = {Update},
  abstract = {This paper contains a factual update to the concept and operation of the performance data analysis and reporting system (PDARS) paper originally presented at the SAE conference, Montreal Canada, 2003 by den Braven and Schade. Since 1999 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been operating a system for the collection, analysis, and reporting of performance-related data from the National Airspace System (NAS). This performance data analysis and reporting system (PDARS) has been installed at twenty Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), nineteen Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities (TRACONs), three service area offices, the FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon, Virginia and FAA Headquarters offices in Washington, DC. The system generates and distributes close to 1000 reports daily for these facilities. PDARS calculates a range of performance measures, including traffic counts, travel times, travel distances, traffic flows, and in-trail separations. It turns these measurement data into information useful to FAA facilities through a\textsuperscript{2}n architecture that features (1) automatic collection and analysis of radar tracks and flight plans, (2) automatic generation and distribution of daily morning reports, (3) sharing of data and reports among facilities, and (4) support for exploratory and causal analysis. PDARS applications at FAA facilities include performance measurement, route and airspace design, noise abatement analysis, traffic flow management initiative assessment and design, training, and support for search and rescue. PDARS has also been used in a range of FAA and NASA studies. Examples are the measurement of actual benefits of the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex airspace, an analysis of the Los Angeles Arrival Enhancement Procedure (AEP), an analysis of the Phoenix Dryheat departure procedure, measurement of navigation accuracy of aircraft using area navigation (RNAV) en route, a study on the detection and analysis of in-close approach changes, an evaluation of the benefits of domestic reduced vertical separation minimum implementation, and a baseline study for the airspace flow program.},

  title = {Integrated Telemetry Analysis Using Human Expert Knowledge and the Logical Analysis of Data},
  abstract = {Telemetry data received from satellites during in-orbit operation are typically analyzed by experts to identify faults that might lead to potential subsystem failures. A typical method is to apply limit-checking procedure to locate off-nominal features which do not fall within the expected normal range of values. Human-experts' analysis is usually limited. It focuses on analyzing selected group of features that would interpret a specific situation that might be taking place onboard the satellite. When the size of telemetry features and number of observations are in the order of hundreds or thousands, a full expert-based analysis is almost impossible to achieve. In this paper, expert-based analysis is leveraged by the automation of the telemetry analysis process based on a machine learning technique called the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a pattern recognition and classification approach that combines ideas and concepts from optimization, combinatorics and Boolean functions. One of the main advantages of LAD is its explanatory power, which offers a classification and an interpretation of the root causes of the events under study. Patterns generated via LAD are easily understood by experts as they are constructed from the features within the set of observations. Consequently, LAD is used in numerous practical applications. We are applying LAD in the process of fault diagnosis and prognosis in satellites by combining the domain expert's knowledge and the knowledge extracted by LAD. The procedure begins by performing a fault tree analysis (FTA) and a list of corrective actions, by domain human experts. This analysis is usually limited by the expert's knowledge to represent known faulty states of the system. However, operation data collected over a period of time can introduce meaningful hidden knowledge about faulty states that were not represented in the original FTA. We apply LAD to find this hidden knowledge in data collected through simulation, testing and in-flight operation. The results reflect significant interpretation power and an effective leverage of the obtained knowledge by the integrated telemetry analysis tool when compared to traditional limit-checking method.},

Monitoring, early anomaly detection and diagnosis are the main concerns of space operations. Service systems analysis specialist deals with massive amount of telemetry data that downloaded from satellite. The ground segment has multiple means to perform the task of telemetry monitoring and analysis. Multivariate analysis introduced as a powerful method in this field. In this paper, a survey on multivariate techniques (PCA-PLS) explained. Then the technique of batch modeling applied for first time to the telemetry of the thermal control system of Nickel-Hydrogen batteries in the power supply system of real satellite during test of batteries. Batch modeling is a partial least squares projections to latent structure (PLS) technique. This technique based on developing a model of evolution for normal batches; the model used for monitoring the new batches, and classifies them as normal or faulty ones. In addition, control charts such as CUSUM and Shewhart used for monitoring and early detection of anomalies. The discussion shows that using these techniques could avoid the failures that had happened if it used.

  abstract = {The Kepler telescope launched into orbit in March 2009, initiating NASA's first mission to discover Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars. Kepler simultaneously collected data for 160,000 target stars at a time over its four-year mission, identifying over 4700 planet candidates, 2300 confirmed or validated planets, and over 2100 eclipsing binaries. While Kepler was designed to discover exoplanets, the long term, ultra-high photometric precision measurements it achieved made it a premier observational facility for stellar astrophysics, especially in the field of asteroseismology, and for variable stars, such as RR Lyraes. The Kepler Science Operations Center (SOC) was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to process the data acquired by Kepler from pixel-level calibrations all the way to identifying transiting planet signatures and subjecting them to a suite of diagnostic tests to establish or break confidence in their planetary nature. Detecting small, rocky planets transiting Sun-like stars presents a variety of daunting challenges, from achieving an unprecedented photometric precision of 20 parts per million (ppm) on 6.5-hour timescales, supporting the science operations, management, processing, and repeated reprocessing of the accumulating data stream. This paper describes how the design of the SOC meets these varied challenges, discusses the architecture of the SOC and how the SOC pipeline is operated and is run on the NAS Pleiades supercomputer, and summarizes the most important pipeline features addressing the multiple computational, image and signal processing challenges posed by Kepler.},

The CYGNSS flight segment consists of 8 microsatellite-class observatories, which represent SwRI's first spacecraft bus design, installed on a Deployment Module for launch. The microsatellites (microsats) are identical in design but provide their own individual contribution to the CYGNSS science data set. Within the first year of the CYGNSS program (Phase A and B), the design has been analyzed, vetted, and reviewed which culminated in a succession of updates and design improvements. This paper will discuss relevant updates to the electrical systems of the microsat, specifically the command and data subsystem (CDS) and the electrical power subsystem (EPS). For the CDS, more detailed analysis of the communication link and maturation of the transceiver module design are presented. The link budget was reviewed by the team and verified via simulation. The transceiver module has moved to a dedicated box consisting of a radio frequency (RF) board and a digital signal processing (DSP) board. For the EPS, a detailed power analysis of the mission has led to an update in the solar array configuration. The details of the power analysis, which is performed in STK and Matlab, are presented.},

@inproceedings{jasperDataProductionFuture2017,
  title = {Data Production on Past and Future {{NASA}} Missions},
  abstract = {Data return is a metric that is commonly publicized for all space science missions. In the early days of the Space Program, this figure was small, and could be described in bits or maybe even megabits. But now, missions are capable of returning data volumes two or three orders of magnitude larger. For example, Voyager 1 and 2 combined produced a little over 5 Terabits of data in 39 years of operation. In contrast, the Cassini mission, launched two decades after Voyager, produced about one and a half times those data volumes in half the time. NISAR, an Earth Science Mission currently in implementation, plans to produce over 28 Petabits of raw data in just 3 years. This means that NISAR will produce about as many data in 30 days as the combined data production of nearly all planetary missions to date. These increases in capability are a result of technology enhancements in two main areas: telecommunications architecture (both space and ground segments) and data storage technology. This paper describes the progression of these two technologies over the course of more than three decades of space missions and provides additional insight into the design of the end-to-end NISAR Data System Architecture. Trends in the data are briefly explored and compared to Moore's Law which provides only a qualitative model for memory growth but not for data production. In summary, early missions are found to be driven by unrefined processes while later missions, having utilized earlier lessons learned, focus more on improvements to flight and ground capabilities. Data return seems to fall into three categories. First, deep space missions are driven by the large distances that limit data return to the Earth. Next, the orbiter infrastructure around Mars helps these missions generate more data than other deep space spacecraft. Finally, near-Earth missions have the greatest capabilities for the studied metrics due to their close proximity to Earth and the ground network availability.},

  abstract = {Launched by NASA on 6 March 2009, the Kepler Mission has been observing more than 100,000 targets in a single patch of sky between the constellations Cygnus and Lyra almost continuously for the last two years looking for planetary systems using the transit method. As of October 2011, the Kepler spacecraft has collected and returned to Earth just over 290 GB of data, identifying 1235 planet candidates with 25 of these candidates confirmed as planets via ground observation. Extracting the telltale signature of a planetary system from stellar photometry where valid signal transients can be as small as a 40 ppm is a difficult and exacting task. The end-to-end process of determining planetary candidates from noisy, raw photometric measurements is discussed. The Kepler mission is described in overview and the Kepler technique for discovering exoplanets is discussed. The design and implementation of the Kepler spacecraft, tracing the data path from photons entering the telescope aperture through raw observation data transmitted to the ground operations team is described. The technical challenges of operating a large aperture photometer with an unprecedented 95 million pixel detector are addressed as well as the onboard technique for processing and reducing the large volume of data produced by the Kepler photometer. The technique and challenge of day-to-day mission operations that result in a very high percentage of time on target is discussed. This includes the day to day process for monitoring and managing the health of the spacecraft, the annual process for maintaining sun on the solar arrays while still keeping the telescope pointed at the fixed science target, the process for safely but rapidly returning to science operations after a spacecraft initiated safing event and the long term anomaly resolution process. The ground data processing pipeline, from the point that science data is received on the ground to the presentation of preliminary planetary candidates and supporting data to the science team for further evaluation is discussed. Ground management, control, exchange and storage of Kepler's large and growing data set is discussed as well as the process and techniques for removing noise sources and applying calibrations to intermediate data products.},

  abstract = {The Boeing Company is designing, developing and manufacturing the Core Stage and Avionics for NASA's heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which will support missions beyond low earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo days. On the SLS vehicle many sensors are selected and used to provide critical information for testing, ground operations, and vehicle flight environments. Appropriate data acquisition systems that can interface and process the selected sensors is important to the success of the program. In this program, multiple data acquisition systems are used to interface with sensors at various development stages of the SLS vehicle, and at different sensor criticality levels. These phased configurations of data acquisition classes and complexity range from gathering sensor data during system level testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), to transmitting flight information after liftoff at the Kennedy Space Center. One challenge that engineers are faced with pertains to how the data acquisition system is defined prior to understanding the quantity and type of sensors required for the application. This paper focuses mainly on the SLS flight system and provides a general overview of the system architecture. The paper also addresses the strategy used to define the data acquisition system, along with the methodology for selecting data acquisition cards that fit with the application.},

  abstract = {The TechSat 21 satellite program is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) technology initiative which has an objective to demonstrate and validate microsatellite cluster system concepts and enabling technologies. The primary experimental objectives are to demonstrate formation flying algorithms and technologies for clustered satellites, and to demonstrate autonomous cluster and spacecraft operations. TechSat 21 consists of three satellites which will fly in various configurations with variable separation distances. Command and control of a cluster of satellites with multiple heterogeneous experimental objectives poses several challenges from a ground perspective. To assist in operating TechSat 21, AFRL is developing a backroom Mission Operations Center (MOC) which will be capable of performing, among other tasks: planning and scheduling; command generation; state-of-health (SOH) monitoring; telemetry playbacks; fault detection, isolation, and resolution (FDIR); data storage; and payload data analysis. The objective of this paper is to describe the MOC architecture, highlight the key components, and outline its planned operational use.},

  title = {A Multi-Center Space Data System Prototype Based on {{CCSDS}} Standards},
  abstract = {Deep space missions beyond earth orbit will require new methods of data communications in order to compensate for increasing Radio Frequency (RF) propagation delay. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard protocols Spacecraft Monitor \& Control (SM\&C), Asynchronous Message Service (AMS), and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) provide such a method. However, the maturity level of this protocol stack is insufficient for mission inclusion at this time. This Space Data System prototype is intended to provide experience which will raise the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of this protocol set. In order to reduce costs, future missions can take advantage of these standard protocols, which will result in increased interoperability between control centers. This prototype demonstrates these capabilities by implementing a realistic space data system in which telemetry is published to control center applications at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). Reverse publishing paths for commanding from each control center are also implemented. The target vehicle consists of realistic flight computer hardware running Core Flight Software (CFS) in the integrated Power, Avionics, and Power (iPAS) Pathfinder Lab at JSC. This prototype demonstrates a potential upgrade path for future Deep Space Network (DSN) modification, in which the automatic error recovery and communication gap compensation capabilities of DTN would be exploited. In addition, SM\&C provides architectural flexibility by allowing new service providers and consumers to be added efficiently anywhere in the network using the common interface provided by SM\&C's Message Abstraction Layer (MAL). In FY 2015, this space data system was enhanced by adding telerobotic operations capability provided by the Robot API Delegate (RAPID) family of protocols developed at NASA. RAPID is one of several candidates for consideration and inclusion in a new international standard being developed by the CCSDS Telerobotic Operations Working Group. Software gateways for the purpose of interfacing RAPID messages with the existing SM\&C based infrastructure were developed. Telerobotic monitor, control, and bridge applications were written in the RAPID framework, which were then tailored to the NAO telerobotic test article hardware, a product of Aldebaran Robotics.},

  title = {System {{Health Monitoring}} for {{Space Mission Operations}}},
  abstract = {Many spacecraft provide an abundance of system status telemetry that is monitored in real time by ground personnel and archived to allow for further analysis. In the flight control room, controllers typically monitor these values using text or graphical displays that incorporate individual parameter limit checking or simple trend analysis. Recent developments in data mining techniques for anomaly detection make it possible to use the wealth of archived system data to produce more sophisticated system health monitoring applications. These "data driven" applications are capable of characterizing and monitoring interactions between multiple parameters and can complement existing practice to provide valuable decision support for mission controllers. Data driven software tools have been successfully applied to mission operations for both the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. These tools have been applied to engineering analysis of spacecraft data to detect unusual events in the data, and to real-time system health monitoring in the flight control room. Augmenting traditional mission control software with advanced monitoring tools can provide controllers with greater insight into the health and performance of the space systems under their watch. Adding heuristic rule based methods that encode system knowledge obtained from seasoned mission controllers can also be helpful to less experienced personnel. We will describe how such techniques have been applied to NASA mission control operations and discuss plans for future mission control system health monitoring software systems.},

  title = {Real-Time Online Health Analytics for Interplanetary Space Missions},
  abstract = {Monitoring the health and well-being of human beings during any manned spaceflight is a critical aspect of the space mission. To date this has been done almost exclusively with telemetry to ground stations and monitoring of the physiological data by physicians. With lunar and Mars missions the transmission latency become problematic, and in additional to longer latency, Mars missions would also be subject to more restricted bandwidth availability and to blackout periods due to the normal rotation of Mars when the lander would be on the far side of the planet relative to earth for roughly half of each Mars solar day. While these blackout period could be reduced or removed with relay satellite in Martian orbit, this may not be practical for early missions to Mars. As such, Autonomous Medical Care has been identified by NASA as one of the top priority technologies to be developed for Mars missions, with seven Risk Categories with that area. Two of these are Monitoring and Prevention; and Medical Informatics, Technologies and Support Systems. In this paper, the Artemis platform, which was developed originally for real-time diagnostics in neonatal intensive care is presented as a solution to these areas of Autonomous Medical Care for Mars missions. This platform has the capability, in addition to real-time diagnostics, to provide supervisory medical monitoring, modularity in deployment of specialized diagnostic algorithms and also the offline (earth-based) development and deployment of new algorithms based on additional mission needs. The platform and these capabilities are described, along with examples of its use. Furthermore, its requirements in terms of resources within the inherently limited resources of a long space mission are also presented and analysed, and a proposed physical architecture for both the space and ground control components are proposed.},

  title = {Approach and Challenges to Science and Mission Planning for the {{European}} Orbiter {{Mars Express}}},
  abstract = {The paper focuses on the end-to-end science operations for the first and only European Mars mission to-date, describing the approaches to science and mission planning and the challenges imposed by the operations constraints. It includes the activities of the instrument and science planning teams to plan and process the collected data. The Mars Express spacecraft has been in orbit around Mars since late 2003. An elliptical, near polar orbit has been chosen as the best trade-off between low-cost launch with little remaining fuel, science operations close to the targets on the Red Planet, and long periods required for transmitting the science data with an affordable communications system. The chosen orbit precesses around Mars, allowing the mapping of the complete surface of Mars at low altitude and good resolution. A high-resolution stereo camera, a mineralogical mapping spectrometer, two atmospheric/surface thermal mapping spectrometers, an energetic neutral atoms analyser, a sub-surface sounding radar and communications equipment in support of lander operations are mounted on the payload face of the spacecraft and compete for observation time, pointing preference and downlink time. The science planning facility performs the trade-off between the competing instrument science requests, planning within an envelope imposed by the power, thermal and illumination resource constraints, as well as the on-board data storage capacity and ground station availability. Different seasonal constraints apply due to the geometry between Mars and Earth, Mars and Sun, but also because of anomalies on the spacecraft that impact the power resource. Once a consolidated science plan has been generated and distributed in the form of a pointing timeline and payload operations requests, the Mars Express mission planning and flight dynamics teams validate the feasibility of the plan. The analysis includes the detailed power usage, spacecraft slew rates, reaction wheel off-loading parameters, illumination and thermal constraint checks. Based on the pointing timeline, orbital events, like eclipses and occultations, and the allocated ground station antennas from the tracking network of the European Space Agency and the Deep Space Network of NASA, the mission planning team generates a communications plan which consists of the switching of the transmitter, downlink and commanding opportunity windows. Tools have been developed within the team to ease and automate the mission planning processes. The tools include the first-ever application based on artificial intelligence technology in mission operations at the European Space Operations Centre (for computing the irregular downlink and uplink plans). Several days prior to execution, the instrument operations requests are updated with detailed and fine-tuned operations parameters. Due to the planning of the instrument operations relative to an orbit event, the execution time uplinked to the instrument is aligned to the latest orbit prediction providing very good accuracy of the orbital events. Once the instrument observations have taken place, the data stored in the on-board mass memory is transferred to the control centre according to the `dump plan', from where the instrument teams pick up the science and housekeeping data for further processing, analysis and publication of the scientific results.},

This technique has many benefits depending on the mission profile, including increased data return, operational simplification, and spectrum efficiency. The present study considers a variation to the ranging technique presented in [1] in order to facilitate implementation in a software-defined radio (SDR). This implementation tracks an uplink PN range code and measures the code phase coincident with the start of downlink telemetry frames. The phase is then embedded in subsequent telemetry frames. The method is implemented in the JHU/APL Frontier Radio and leverages the PN ranging design from the NASA New Horizons communications system. Initial test results are summarized and indicate that the method is viable for space exploration.},

  abstract = {The European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) arrived at Mars on October 19, 2016, three days after releasing the Schiaparelli Lander on a ballistic trajectory to Meridiani Planum. During the separation event, and subsequently during Schiaparelli's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), the NASA-provided Electra Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) payload onboard TGO was used to record signals from the Schiaparelli Lander for post-processing on the ground to recover both tracking of the lander's carrier signal and reconstruction of the lander's 8 kb/s telemetry. In addition, ESA's Mars Express orbiter recorded the Schiaparelli signal, with ground post-processing providing independent tracking of the lander carrier signal, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India was configured to provide real-time detection of the lander carrier signal. While an anomaly in the latter stages of EDL led to loss of the lander, these critical event data sets, and in particular the telemetry reconstruction enabled by the TGO Electra recording, proved essential in enabling detailed diagnosis of the anomaly. While the loss of the lander during EDL precluded the planned surface relay operations, the preparations for that activity provide important lessons learned for future Mars relay support scenarios.},

Transforming statistical Linked Data into a star schema to populate a relational database and applying a common OLAP engine do not allow to optimise OLAP queries on RDF or to directly propagate changes of Linked Data sources to clients. Therefore, as a new way to interact with statistics published as Linked Data, we investigate the problem of executing OLAP queries via SPARQL on an RDF store. First, we define projection, slice, dice and roll-up operations on single data cubes published as Linked Data reusing the RDF Data Cube vocabulary and show how a nested set of operations lead to an OLAP query. Second, we show how to transform an OLAP query to a SPARQL query which generates all required tuples from the data cube. In a small experiment, we show the applicability of our OLAP-to-SPARQL mapping in answering a business question in the financial domain.},

Online monitoring of data streams has emerged as an important research undertaking. Estimating the frequency of the items on these streams is an important aggregation and summary technique for both stream mining and data management systems with a broad range of applications. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art progress on methods of identifying frequent items from data streams. It describes different kinds of models for frequent items mining task. For general models such as cash register and Turnstile, we classify existing algorithms into sampling-based, counting-based, and hashing-based categories. The processing techniques and data synopsis structure of each algorithm are described and compared by evaluation measures. Accordingly, as an extension of the general data stream model, four more specific models including time-sensitive model, distributed model, hierarchical and multi-dimensional model, and skewed data model are introduced. The characteristics and limitations of the algorithms of each model are presented, and open issues waiting for study and improvement are discussed.},

Given a keyword query, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells (ranked according to the relevance scores of cell documents w.r.t. the given query) in the text cube. We define a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring and ranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k answers. The proposed approaches support a general class of IR-style relevance scoring formulas that satisfy certain basic and common properties. One of them uses more time for pre-processing and less time for answering online queries; and the other one is more efficient in pre-processing and consumes more time for online queries. Experimental studies on the ASRS dataset are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

However, for the same object, there usually exist conflicts among the collected multi-source information. To tackle this challenge, truth discovery, which integrates multi-source noisy information by estimating the reliability of each source, has emerged as a hot topic. Several truth discovery methods have been proposed for various scenarios, and they have been successfully applied in diverse application domains. In this survey, we focus on providing a comprehensive overview of truth discovery methods, and summarizing them from different aspects. We also discuss some future directions of truth discovery research. We hope that this survey will promote a better understanding of the current progress on truth discovery, and offer some guidelines on how to apply these approaches in application domains.},

  title = {Contrast {{Subgraph Mining}} from {{Coherent Cores}}},
  abstract = {Graph pattern mining methods can extract informative and useful patterns from large-scale graphs and capture underlying principles through the overwhelmed information. Contrast analysis serves as a keystone in various fields and has demonstrated its effectiveness in mining valuable information. However, it has been long overlooked in graph pattern mining. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the concept of contrast subgraph, that is, a subset of nodes that have significantly different edges or edge weights in two given graphs of the same node set. The major challenge comes from the gap between the contrast and the informativeness. Because of the widely existing noise edges in real-world graphs, the contrast may lead to subgraphs of pure noise. To avoid such meaningless subgraphs, we leverage the similarity as the cornerstone of the contrast. Specifically, we first identify a coherent core, which is a small subset of nodes with similar edge structures in the two graphs, and then induce contrast subgraphs from the coherent cores. Moreover, we design a general family of coherence and contrast metrics and derive a polynomial-time algorithm to efficiently extract contrast subgraphs. Extensive experiments verify the necessity of introducing coherent cores as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Real-world applications demonstrate the tremendous potentials of contrast subgraph mining.},

  volume = {21},
  issn = {0219-3116},
  shorttitle = {Graph {{OLAP}}},
  abstract = {Databases and data warehouse systems have been evolving from handling normalized spreadsheets stored in relational databases, to managing and analyzing diverse application-oriented data with complex interconnecting structures. Responding to this emerging trend, graphs have been growing rapidly and showing their critical importance in many applications, such as the analysis of XML, social networks, Web, biological data, multimedia data and spatiotemporal data. Can we extend useful functions of databases and data warehouse systems to handle graph structured data? In particular, OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) has been a popular tool for fast and user-friendly multi-dimensional analysis of data warehouses. Can we OLAP graphs? Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there are no OLAP tools available that can interactively view and analyze graph data from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. In this paper, we argue that it is critically important to OLAP graph structured data and propose a novel Graph OLAP framework. According to this framework, given a graph dataset with its nodes and edges associated with respective attributes, a multi-dimensional model can be built to enable efficient on-line analytical processing so that any portions of the graphs can be generalized/specialized dynamically, offering multiple, versatile views of the data. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, starting from basic definitions, i.e., what are dimensions and measures in the Graph OLAP scenario, we develop a conceptual framework for data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations, and classify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological OLAP. Second, we show how a graph cube can be materialized by calculating a special kind of measure called aggregated graph and how to implement it efficiently. This includes both full materialization and partial materialization where constraints are enforced to obtain an iceberg cube. As we can see, due to the increased structural complexity of data, aggregated graphs that depend on the underlying ``network'' properties of the graph dataset are much harder to compute than their traditional OLAP counterparts. Third, to provide more flexible, interesting and informative OLAP of graphs, we further propose a discovery-driven multi-dimensional analysis model to ensure that OLAP is performed in an intelligent manner, guided by expert rules and knowledge discovery processes. We outline such a framework and discuss some challenging research issues for discovery-driven Graph OLAP.},

This paper develops a hierarchical modeling methodology for open cyber-physical systems that combines techniques in estimation theory with those in data mining to reliably capture complex system behavior at different levels of abstraction. Our technique is also novel in the sense that it provides a measure of confidence in predictions. An application to green transportation is discussed, where the goal is to reduce vehicular fuel consumption and carbon footprint. First-principle models of cyber-physical systems can be very complex and include a large number of parameters, whereas empirical regression models are often unreliable when a high number of parameters is involved. Our new modeling technique, called the Sparse Regression Cube, simultaneously (i) partitions sparse, high-dimensional measurements into subspaces within which reliable linear regression models apply and (ii) determines the best reliable model for each partition, quantifying uncertainty in output prediction. Evaluation results show that the framework significantly improves modeling accuracy compared to previous approaches and correctly quantifies prediction error, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.},

  abstract = {Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in data warehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down versus bottom-up. The former, represented by the multiway array cube (called the multiway) algorithm, aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of a priori pruning when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure values satisfy a threshold, called the iceberg condition). The latter, represented by BUC, computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates a priori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; however, it does not fully explore multidimensional simultaneous aggregation. In this paper, we present a new method, star-cubing, that integrates the strengths of the previous two algorithms and performs aggregations on multiple dimensions simultaneously. It utilizes a star-tree structure, extends the simultaneous aggregation methods, and enables the pruning of the group-bys that do not satisfy the iceberg condition. Our performance study shows that star-cubing is highly efficient and outperforms the previous methods},

  abstract = {Frequent pattern mining is an essential theme in data mining. Existing algorithms usually use a bottom-up search strategy. However, for very high dimensional data, this strategy cannot fully utilize the minimum support constraint to prune the rowset search space. In this paper, we propose a new method called top-down mining together with a novel row enumeration tree to make full use of the pruning power of the minimum support constraint. Furthermore, to efficiently check if a rowset is closed, we develop a method called the trace-based method. Based on these methods, an algorithm called TD-Close is designed for mining a complete set of frequent closed patterns. To enhance its performance further, we improve it by using new pruning strategies and new data structures that lead to a new algorithm TTD-Close. Our performance study shows that the top-down strategy is effective in cutting down search space and saving memory space, while the trace-based method facilitates the closeness-checking. As a result, the algorithm TTD-Close outperforms the bottom-up search algorithms such as Carpenter and FPclose in most cases. It also runs faster than TD-Close.},

Brown Dwarf distributes a centralized indexing structure among peers on-the-fly, reducing cube creation and querying times by enforcing parallelization. Analytical queries are naturally performed on-line through cooperating nodes that form an unstructured Peer-to-Peer overlay. Updates are also performed on-line, eliminating the usually costly over-night process. Moreover, the system employs an adaptive replication scheme that adjusts to the workload skew as well as the network churn by expanding or shrinking the units of the distributed data structure. Our system has been thoroughly evaluated on an actual testbed: it manages to accelerate cube creation up and querying up to several tens of times compared to the centralized solution by exploiting the capabilities of the available network nodes working in parallel. It also manages to quickly adapt even after sudden bursts in load and remains unaffected with a considerable fraction of frequent node failures. These advantages are even more apparent for dense and skewed data cubes and workloads.},

  abstract = {Data streams become more and more important in modern computer infrastructures. The amount of data processed by computer systems continuously increased in the past years, in a way that storing all of the data is not effective or even impossible. Consequently the most feasible way to get information out of the data is to compute it in a stream processing manner.  This paper proposes an iceberg cube algorithm which is able to compute an incremental iceberg cube with every new data record in a window of a stream. An iceberg cube is a data cube in which all attribute value combinations have to fulfill an aggregation condition. In contrast to many algorithms which use a combination of sorting and partitioning, the new PopUp-Cubing algorithm uses hashing to find the right cells for aggregation. PopUp-Cubing supports pruning in the incremental iceberg cube and is able to perform multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation. Additionally, PopUp-Cubing has an indicator for cells that pop up or submerge at the metaphorical water surface of an iceberg cube. This happens, if the aggregated value of cells changes over time. This indicator can help to identify important changes in a data stream. The algorithm is evaluated with a network flow dataset. As the results will show, the new PopUp-Cubing algorithm outperforms a batch like algorithm that computes every window by a factor of about 360.},

  abstract = {The computation of high-dimension Data Cube in data warehouse is of much importance. Dwarf is a highly compressed structure for computing and storing data cubes which can be materialized completely. During the constructing process, each closed node is stored in disk. While the computation of aggregation units needs to access the closed nodes in the disk frequently. For avoid accessing the unnecessary closed nodes in disk, in this paper, we propose an optimized algorithm named Q-Dwarf. The property of this algorithm guarantees that once the closed nodes are written to disk, they will not be read out again, and query algorithm and update algorithm are both based on files. Experimental results show that the performance of the new algorithm outperforms that of the Dwarf algorithm, and the query and update algorithms are efficient for data warehousing.},

Several efforts were devoted to this problem through closed cubes, where cells preserving aggregation semantics are losslessly reduced to one cell. In this paper, we introduce the concept of closed non derivable data cube, denoted CNDCND\textbackslash{}mathcal\{CND\} - CC\textbackslash{}mathcal\{C\}ube, which generalizes the notion of bi-dimensional frequent closed non derivable patterns to the multidimensional context. We propose a novel algorithm to mine CNDCND\textbackslash{}mathcal\{CND\} - CC\textbackslash{}mathcal\{C\}ube from multidimensional databases considering three anti-monotone constraints, namely ``to be frequent'', ``to be non derivable'' and ``to be minimal generator''. Experiments show that our proposal provides the smallest representation of a data cube and thus is the most efficient for saving storage space.},

  abstract = {Formal concept analysis (FCA) has been successfully used in several Computer Science fields such as databases, software engineering, and information retrieval, and in many domains like medicine, psychology, linguistics and ecology. In data warehouses, users exploit data hypercubes (i.e., multi-way tables) mainly through online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques to extract useful information from data for decision support purposes.Many topics have attracted researchers in the area of data warehousing: data warehouse design and multidimensional modeling, efficient cube materialization (pre-computation), physical data organization, query optimization and approximation, discovery-driven data exploration as well as cube compression and mining. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to apply or adapt data mining approaches and advanced statistical analysis techniques for extracting knowledge (e.g., outliers, clusters, rules, closed n-sets) from multidimensional data. Such approaches or techniques cover (but are not limited to) FCA, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, log-linear modeling, and non-negative multi-way array factorization. Since data cubes are generally large and highly dimensional, and since cells contain consolidated (e.g., mean value), multidimensional and temporal data, such facts lead to challenging research issues in mining data cubes. In this presentation, we will give an overview of related work and show how FCA theory (with possible extensions) can be used to extract valuable and actionable knowledge from data warehouses.},

  abstract = {A unit cube in k-dimension (or a k-cube) is defined as the Cartesian product R1\texttimes{}R2\texttimes{$\cdots\times$}Rk, where each Ri is a closed interval on the real line of the form [ai,ai+1]. The cubicity of G, denoted as cub(G), is the minimum k such that G is the intersection graph of a collection of k-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be solved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity. In most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube representation of the given graph. It is known that for a graph G, cub(G){$\leqslant\lfloor$}2n3{$\rfloor$}. Recently it has been shown that for a graph G, cub(G){$\leqslant$}4({$\Delta$}+1)lnn, where n and {$\Delta$} are the number of vertices and maximum degree of G, respectively. In this paper, we show that for a bipartite graph G=(A{$\cup$}B,E) with |A|=n1, |B|=n2, n1{$\leqslant$}n2, and {$\Delta{'}$}=min\{{$\Delta$}A,{$\Delta$}B\}, where {$\Delta$}A=maxa{$\in$}Ad(a) and {$\Delta$}B=maxb{$\in$}Bd(b), d(a) and d(b) being the degree of a and b in G, respectively, cub(G){$\leqslant$}2({$\Delta{'}$}+2){$\lceil$}lnn2{$\rceil$}. We also give an efficient randomized algorithm to construct the cube representation of G in 3({$\Delta{'}$}+2){$\lceil$}lnn2{$\rceil$} dimensions. The reader may note that in general {$\Delta{'}$} can be much smaller than {$\Delta$}.},

These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1--2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a "one size fits all" solution, infact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of "from scratch" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for yesterday's needs.},

A new type of data cube, compact data cube like condensed cube and quotient cube, was proposed to solve the problem. It compresses data cube dramatically. However, its query cost is so high that it cannot be used in most applications. This paper introduces the semi-closed cube to reduce the size of data cube and achieve almost the same query response time as the data cube does. Semi-closed cube is a generalization of condensed cube and quotient cube and is constructed from a quotient cube. When the query cost of quotient cube is higher than a given threshold, semi-closed cube selects some views and picks a fellow for each of them. All the tuples of those views are materialized except those closed by their fellows. To find a tuple of those views, users only need to scan the view and its fellow. Thus, their query performance is improved. Experiments were conducted using a real-world data set. The results show that semi-closed cube is an effective approach of data cube.},

Equivalence partitioning will be carried out In this stage, and the minimum aggregation cube of each equivalence partitioning will be the key with its aggregate value. According to the minimum aggregation cubes, we can get the quotient cubes. In order to improve the speed of parallel computing and reduce network traffic, equivalence class division will be executed locally after the Map stage, it is named as combiner stage. In this paper, MapReduce model is used to improve the efficiency of building quotient cube because of its ability of parallel computing in a large amount of data. In addition, the experiment proved that, under certain circumstances, increasing the number of Mapper/Reducer task can reduce the building time effectively, and improve the construction efficiency.},

  isbn = {978-1-58113-737-8},

COUNT, SUM, and covering graph of the quotient cube as a visualization tool of minimal multidimensional associations. With this intention, we introduce two novel concepts: the cube transversals and the cube closures over the cube lattice of a categorical database relation. We propose a levelwise merging algorithm for mining minimal cube transversals with a single database scan. We introduce the cube connection, show that it is a Galois connection and derive a closure operator over the cube lattice. Using cube transversals and closures, we define a new characterization of boundary sets which provide a condensed representation of version spaces used to enhance supervised classification. The algorithm designed for computing such borders improves the complexity of previous proposals. We also introduce the concept of closed cube lattice and show that it is isomorph to on one hand the Galois lattice and on the other hand the quotient cube w.r.t. COUNT, SUM. Proposed in [16], the quotient cube is a succinct summary of a datacube preserving the Rollup/Drilldown semantics. We show that the quotient cube w.r.t. COUNT, SUM and the closed cube lattice have a similar expression power but the latter has the smallest possible size. Finally we focus on the multidimensional association issue and introduce the covering graph of the quotient cube which provides the user with a visualization tool of minimal multidimensional associations.},

However, the absence of a unique schema adds complexity to analytical applications, in which a single analysis often involves large sets of data with different schemas. In this paper we propose an original approach to OLAP on collections stored in document-oriented databases. The basic idea is to stop fighting against schema variety and welcome it as an inherent source of information wealth in schemaless sources. Our approach builds on four stages: schema extraction, schema integration, FD enrichment, and querying; these stages are discussed in detail in the paper. To make users aware of the impact of schema variety, we propose a set of indicators related for instance to query completeness and precision.},

This paper presents an OLAP tool named Falseto (Former AnalyticaL Sessions for lEss Tedious Olap), that is meant to assist query and session composition, by letting the user summarize, browse, query, and reuse former analytical sessions. Falseto's implementation on top of a formal framework is detailed. We also report the experiments we run to obtain and analyze real OLAP sessions and assess Falseto with them.

Intensional query answering can help by providing a concise description of extensional answers (i.e., the sets of retrieved facts), generally relying on knowledge like integrity constraints, taxonomies, or patterns discovered from data. This paper proposes a framework for computing an intensional answer to an OLAP query by leveraging on the previous queries in the current session. Such intensional answer is concise and semantically rich, and allows the size of the extensional answers returned to be reduced, so as to achieve an effective trade-off between conciseness and informational content. After describing the general framework, we propose a specific instantiation that relies on previous contributions in cube modeling and intensional query answering.},

We first study how to sample each source and combine the samples to approximate any OLAP query. We then consider a streaming context, where a data warehouse is built by streams of different sources. We first show a lower bound on the size of the memory necessary to approximate queries and then consider a statistical hypothesis where some attributes determine fixed distributions of the measure. We use the sampling methods to learn the statistical model and approximate OLAP queries. In this case, we approximate OLAP queries with a finite memory. We apply the method to a dataset which simulates the data of sensors, which provide weather parameters over time and locations from different sources.},

  abstract = {We present the data reduction pipeline for CHARIS, a high-contrast integral-field spectrograph for the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from the raw reads using the measured nonlinear pixel response, and reconstructs the data cube using one of three extraction algorithms: aperture photometry, optimal extraction, or \$\textbackslash{}chi\^2\$ fitting. We measure and apply both a detector flatfield and a lenslet flatfield and reconstruct the wavelength- and position-dependent lenslet point-spread function (PSF) from images taken with a tunable laser. We use these measured PSFs to implement a \$\textbackslash{}chi\^2\$-based extraction of the data cube, with typical residuals of \textasciitilde{}5\% due to imperfect models of the undersampled lenslet PSFs. The full two-dimensional residual of the \$\textbackslash{}chi\^2\$ extraction allows us to model and remove correlated read noise, dramatically improving CHARIS' performance. The \$\textbackslash{}chi\^2\$ extraction produces a data cube that has been deconvolved with the line-spread function, and never performs any interpolations of either the data or the individual lenslet spectra. The extracted data cube also includes uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. CHARIS' software is parallelized, written in Python and Cython, and freely available on github with a separate documentation page. Astrometric and spectrophotometric calibrations of the data cubes and PSF subtraction will be treated in a forthcoming paper.},

The correlation present over all dimensions, spatial, temporal and spectral, of solar data-sets suggests the use of a 3D base wavelet decomposition, to achieve higher compression rates. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the recent JPEG2000 Part 10 standard, known as JP3D, for the lossless compression of several types of solar data-cubes. We explore the differences in: a) The compressibility of broad-band or narrow-band time-sequence; I or V Stokes profiles in spectropolarimetric data-sets; b) Compressing data in [x,y, {$\lambda$}] packages at different times or data in [x,y,t] packages of different wavelength; c) Compressing a single large data-cube or several smaller data-cubes; d) Compressing data which is under-sampled or super-sampled with respect to the diffraction cut-off.},

  title = {Efficient {{Analytical Queries}} on {{Semantic Web Data Cubes}}},
  abstract = {The amount of multidimensional data published on the semantic web (SW) is constantly increasing, due to initiatives such as Open Data and Open Government Data, among other ones. Models, languages, and tools, that allow to obtain valuable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are typically represented as data cubes, and exploited using Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is the current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW.Since QB does not include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have proposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the need of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are represented on the SW, we need tools to analyze them. However, writing efficient analytical queries over SW cubes demands a deep knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. These skills are not common in typical analytical users. Also, OLAP languages like MDX are far from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools to exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken to promote the publication of such data. We address this problem in this paper. Our approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using OLAP operations over cubes, without dealing with SW standards. For this, we devised CQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language that operates over cubes. Using the metadata provided by QB4OLAP, we translate CQL queries into SPARQL. Then, we propose query improvement strategies to produce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting SPARQL query optimization techniques. We evaluate our approach using the Star-Schema benchmark, showing that our proposal outperforms others. A web application that allows querying SW data cubes using CQL, completes our contributions.},

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) serves as the foundation for the publication of a growing amount of semantic web data still largely untapped by data analysis. RDF data, however, do not typically follow an MD structure and, therefore, elude traditional OLAP. We propose an approach for superimposing MD structures over arbitrary RDF datasets. On top of that, we present a high-level querying mechanism to express MD queries, which can be automatically translated into SPARQL queries over the source data. As a consequence, data analysts that are unfamiliar with SPARQL may still incorporate RDF data sources into the analysis. Superimposed MD schemas also serve as foundation for Semantic Web Analysis Graphs which capture analysis processes for increased self-service capabilities.},

  volume = {30},

  abstract = {In multidimensional data models intended for online analytic processing (OLAP), data are viewed as points in a multidimensional space. Each dimension has structure, described by a directed graph of categories, a set of members for each category, and a child/parent relation between members. An important application of this structure is to use it to infer summarizability, that is, whether an aggregate view defined for some category can be correctly derived from a set of precomputed views defined for other categories. A dimension is called structurally heterogeneous if two members in a given category are allowed to have ancestors in different categories. In this article, we propose a class of integrity constraints, dimension constraints, that allow us to reason about summarizability in heterogeneous dimensions. We introduce the notion of frozen dimensions which are minimal homogeneous dimension instances representing the different structures that are implicitly combined in a heterogeneous dimension. Frozen dimensions provide the basis for efficiently testing the implication of dimension constraints and are a useful aid to understanding heterogeneous dimensions. We give a sound and complete algorithm for solving the implication of dimension constraints that uses heuristics based on the structure of the dimension and the constraints to speed up its execution. We study the intrinsic complexity of the implication problem and the running time of our algorithm.},

The model is also made as generic as possible to be open to new extensions but at the same time closed for modifications. This enables maintaining interoperability throughout different versions of the data model. We define the necessary building blocks for metadata discovery, serialization of time series data and understanding it by clients. We present several categories of time series science cases with examples of implementation. We also take into account the most pressing topics for time series providers like tracking original images for every individual point of a light curve or time-derived axes like frequency for gravitational wave analysis. The main motivation for the creation of a new model is to provide a unified time series data publishing standard - not only for light curves but also more generic time series data, e.g., radial velocity curves, power spectra, hardness ratio, provenance linkage, etc. The flexibility is the most crucial part of our model - we are not dependent on any physical domain or frame models. While images or spectra are already stable and standardized products, the time series related domains are still not completely evolved and new ones will likely emerge in near future. That is why we need to keep models like Time Series Cube DM independent of any underlying physical models. In our opinion, this is the only correct and sustainable way for future development of IVOA standards.},

In this paper we introduce a formal data model where the main object is the data cube, and define OLAP operations using this model, independent of the underlying representation of the cube.

The images of the Br\$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ and H\$\_2 \textbackslash{}lambda 21218\$ emission lines from the treated data cube of the nuclear region of NGC 5643 reveal the existence of ionized and molecular-gas clouds around the nucleus, which cannot be seen clearly in the images from the non-treated data cube of this galaxy. The ionized-gas clouds represent the narrow-line region, in the form of a bicone. We observe a good correspondence between the positions of the ionized-gas clouds in the Br\$\textbackslash{}gamma\$ image and in an [O III] image, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, of the nuclear region of this galaxy convolved with an estimate of the point-spread function of the data cube of NGC 5643. The morphologies of the ionized and molecular gas seem to be compatible with the existence of a molecular torus/disc that collimates the active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission. The molecular gas may also flow along this torus/disc, feeding the AGN. This scenario is compatible with the unified model for AGNs.},

  title = {Scalable {{Data Cube Analysis}} over {{Big Data}}},
  abstract = {Data cubes are widely used as a powerful tool to provide multidimensional views in data warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). However, with increasing data sizes, it is becoming computationally expensive to perform data cube analysis. The problem is exacerbated by the demand of supporting more complicated aggregate functions (e.g. CORRELATION, Statistical Analysis) as well as supporting frequent view updates in data cubes. This calls for new scalable and efficient data cube analysis systems. In this paper, we introduce HaCube, an extension of MapReduce, designed for efficient parallel data cube analysis on large-scale data by taking advantages from both MapReduce (in terms of scalability) and parallel DBMS (in terms of efficiency). We also provide a general data cube materialization algorithm which is able to facilitate the features in MapReduce-like systems towards an efficient data cube computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how HaCube supports view maintenance through either incremental computation (e.g. used for SUM or COUNT) or recomputation (e.g. used for MEDIAN or CORRELATION). We implement HaCube by extending Hadoop and evaluate it based on the TPC-D benchmark over billions of tuples on a cluster with over 320 cores. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and practicality of HaCube for cube analysis over a large amount of data in a distributed environment.},

  abstract = {Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.},

However, analysts need to issue multidimensional queries. For example, an analyst may need to select not just the most profitable stores or--separately--the most profitable products, but simultaneous sets of stores and products fulfilling some profitability constraints. To fill this need, we propose a new operator, the diamond dice. Because of the interaction between dimensions, the computation of diamonds is challenging. We present the first diamond-dicing experiments on large data sets. Experiments show that we can compute diamond cubes over fact tables containing 100 million facts in less than 35 minutes using a standard PC.},

  abstract = {Mining colossal itemsets from high dimensional datasets have gained focus in recent times. The conventional algorithms expend most of the time in mining small and mid-sized itemsets, which do not enclose valuable and complete information for decision making. Mining Frequent Colossal Closed Itemsets (FCCI) from a high dimensional dataset play a highly significant role in decision making for many applications, especially in the field of bioinformatics. To mine FCCI from a high dimensional dataset, the existing preprocessing techniques fail to prune the complete set of irrelevant features and irrelevant rows. Besides, the state-of-the-art algorithms for the same are sequential and computationally expensive. The proposed work highlights an Effective Improved Parallel Preprocessing (EIPP) technique to prune the complete set of irrelevant features and irrelevant rows from high dimensional dataset and a novel efficient Parallel Frequent Colossal Closed Itemset Mining (PFCCIM) algorithm. Further, the PFCCIM algorithm is integrated with a novel Rowset Cardinality Table (RCT), an efficient method to check the closeness of a rowset and also an efficient pruning strategy to cut down the mining search space. The proposed PFCCIM algorithm is the first parallel algorithm to mine FCCI from a high dimensional dataset. The performance study shows the improved effectiveness of the proposed EIPP technique over the existing preprocessing techniques and the improved efficiency of the proposed PFCCIM algorithm over the existing algorithms.},

Our system employs an adaptive scheme that automatically adjusts the level of indexing according to the granularity of the incoming queries, without assuming any prior knowledge of the workload. Efficient roll-up and drill-down operations take place in order to maximize the performance by minimizing query flooding. Updates are performed on-line, with minimal communication overhead, depending on the level of consistency needed. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that, on top of the advantages that a distributed storage offers, our method answers the vast majority of incoming queries, both point and aggregate ones, without flooding the network and without causing significant storage or load imbalance. Our scheme proves to be especially efficient in cases of skewed workloads, even when these change dynamically with time. At the same time, it manages to preserve the hierarchical nature of data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards the support of concept hierarchies in DHTs.},

  abstract = {The implementation of condition-based maintenance continues to face several challenges especially in the aeronautics field. While it is true that time-based maintenance dominates the industry today, it is believed that condition monitoring could yield promising results with a better compromise on cost over effectiveness in the long run. The aim of condition-based monitoring in aeronautics is, based on the available system data (e.g., flight, event and maintenance data), to evaluate the current health state of an aircraft component and to estimate its remaining useful life. Several approaches have been studied in condition-based maintenance with the most promising being data-driven modeling. This paper proposes a comparison of a set of data-driven modeling techniques to perform prognostics on a critical component of the jet engine bleed system. The novelty of our work is twofold. First, we perform this comparative study on a real case study of a critical valve of the aircraft bleed system. Fielded data from different data sources are used in the models. To our knowledge, this is the first case study that merges data from the computer central maintenance system (fault messages), maintenance data, and flight data on a prognostics system. Second, a variety of data-driven techniques are compared from neural nets to regression support machines. The models are compared using the standard metrics of absolute, mean, and squared errors. A regressive accuracy curve is also used to compare the models along different prediction window sizes. The results show the best model comprised information from all data sources. The data that most contributed to the performance improvement was the maintenance, flight and fault data, in this order. This result comes to reinforce the notion that it is more difficult to extract quantitative information from fault events than flight data with data-driven regressive methods.},

  abstract = {Data cube has been playing an essential role in fast OLAP (online analytical processing) in many multi-dimensional data warehouses. However, there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality, e.g., over 100 dimensions, and moderate size, e.g., around 106 tuples. No feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets. Experience tells us that although data analysis tasks may involve a high dimensional space, most OLAP operations are performed only on a small number of dimensions at a time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel method that computes a thin layer of the data cube together with associated value-list indices. This layer, while being manageable in size, will be capable of supporting flexible and fast OLAP operations in the original high dimensional space. Through experiments we will show that the method has I/O costs that scale nicely with dimensionality. Furthermore, the costs are comparable to that of accessing an existing data cube when full materialization is possible.},

Cubing methods based on inverted indices, such as Frag-Cubing, are efficient alternatives to conventional approaches of computing OLAP data cubes over Big Data. However, similar to other memory-based cube solutions, the efficiency of such methods is constrained by available dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). In this paper, we implement and test the hybrid inverted cubing (HIC) method, which adopts a hybrid memory system, with main goal of able to compute and update BIG data cubes (with high dimensionality and high number of tuples). HIC stores the most frequent attribute values in DRAM; the remaining attribute values are retained in external memory. Tests using a relation with 480 dimensions and 107 tuples show that HIC is three times slower than Frag-Cubing when computing a data cube, and approximately 13 times faster than Frag-Cubing when answering complex cube queries. A BIG data cube with 60 dimensions and 109 tuples was computed by HIC using 110 GB of RAM and 286 GB of external memory, while Frag-Cubing could not compute such a cube in same machine.},

In fact, the massive automatic data collection has generated a new genre of dataset, termed as `high-dimensional data', which is characterized by a relatively small number of rows, in comparison to that of large number of columns (or dimensions). Among the vast data mining tasks, association rules have been extensively employed so as to describe the correlations between the variables found in a dataset. The task of mining association rules highly relies on the efficiency of the algorithms to extract all frequent itemsets that exist in the database. The focus towards improving run time and memory consumption of algorithms is strongly influenced by search strategies, effective pruning strategies, and the method of closure checking. Neither depth- nor breadth-first search may exert any variance without these techniques, mainly because the search space appears similar. With that, this paper investigated the strategies implemented in both row and column enumeration-based algorithms, hence proposing the RARE; a breadth-first bottom-up row-enumeration algorithm, in mining colossal closed itemsets in high-dimensional data.},

  abstract = {On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) dimensions are usually modeled as a set of elements connected by a hierarchical relationship. To ensure summarizability, a dimension is required to be strict, that is, every element of the dimension must have a unique ancestor in each of its ancestor categories. In practice, elements in a dimension are often reclassified, meaning that their rollups are changed. After this operation the dimension may become non-strict. To fix this problem, we propose to compute a set of minimal r-repairs for the new non-strict dimension. Each minimal r-repair is a strict dimension that keeps the result of the reclassification, and is obtained by performing a minimum number of insertions and deletions to the dimension graph. We show that, although in the general case finding an r-repair is NP-complete, for real-world hierarchy schemas, computing such repairs can be done in polynomial time. Further, we propose efficient heuristic-based algorithms for computing r-repairs, and discuss their computational complexity. We also perform experiments over synthetic and real-world dimensions to show the plausibility of our approach.},

We can extract data from a single MOLAP in different possible ways. There have been many kinds of research to make this analytical process more efficient. But the research area, of extracting data from multiple MOLAPs, has been explored hardly. However, we have proposed a new model for faster querying in multiple MOLAPs using snowflake schema. This model uses array index reference, for creating a MOLAP by joining two-dimensional databases. Thus we can derive summarized MOLAP from fundamental MOLAP. Then we have used summarized MOLAP for creating a fact table, which preserves the summarized data. Our model provides a satisfactory result after comparing it with the MySQL database result.},

However, traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems and techniques were not designed for sequence data and they are incapable of supporting sequence data analysis. In this paper, we propose the concept of Sequence OLAP, or S-OLAP for short. The biggest distinction of S-OLAP from traditional OLAP is that a sequence can be characterized not only by the attributes' values of its constituting items, but also by the subsequence/substring patterns it possesses. This paper studies many aspects related to Sequence OLAP. The concepts of sequence cuboid and sequence data cube are introduced. A prototype S-OLAP system is built in order to validate the proposed concepts. The prototype is able to support "pattern-based" grouping and aggregation, which is currently not supported by any OLAP system. The implementation details of the prototype system as well as experimental results are presented.},

Many data mining algorithms for high-dimensional datasets have been put forward, but the sheer numbers of these algorithms with varying features and application scenarios have complicated making suitable choices. Therefore, we present a general survey of multiple association rule mining algorithms applicable to high-dimensional datasets. The main characteristics and relative merits of these algorithms are explained, as well, pointing out areas for improvement and optimization strategies that might be better adapted to high-dimensional datasets, according to previous studies. Generally speaking, association rule mining algorithms that merge diverse optimization methods with advanced computer techniques can better balance scalability and interpretability.},

  abstract = {The PnP (Pipe 'n Prune) approach is considered one of the most promising approaches for partial cube computation over distributed memory computer architectures, however it generates a huge amount of redundant data. In general, PnP does not consider data uniformity, named skew, when partitioning its workload and, thus, it imposes a maximum data redundancy even with uniform data. Due to this scenario, we implement P2CDM (acronym of Parallel Cube Computation with Distributed Memory) approach which has minimized communication and low data redundancy. Globally, at the entire cluster, P2CDM automatically generates data redundancy only for skewed values among all dimensions of a Data Warehouse. Locally, at each host, P2CDM provides cube cells pruning using MCG approach. The result is a distributed approach that computes massive full or partial data cubes over a cluster of commodity PCs. The experiments demonstrated that both approaches have similar speedup, but P2CDM approach is 20-25\% faster and consumes 30-40\% less memory at each host of the cluster, when compared to PnP approach.},

  shorttitle = {Stream {{Cube}}},
  abstract = {Real-time surveillance systems, telecommunication systems, and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform on-line multi-level, multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream\_cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data.For fast online multi-dimensional analysis of stream data, three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effective computation of stream cubes. First, a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi-resolution model to register time-related data: the more recent data are registered at finer resolution, whereas the more distant data are registered at coarser resolution. This design reduces the overall storage of time-related data and adapts nicely to the data analysis tasks commonly encountered in practice. Second, instead of materializing cuboids at all levels, we propose to maintain a small number of critical layers. Flexible analysis can be efficiently performed based on the concept of observation layer and minimal interesting layer. Third, an efficient stream data cubing algorithm is developed which computes only the layers (cuboids) along a popular path and leaves the other cuboids for query-driven, on-line computation. Based on this design methodology, stream data cube can be constructed and maintained incrementally with a reasonable amount of memory, computation cost, and query response time. This is verified by our substantial performance study.},

The Iceberg-CUBE problem is to compute only those group-by partitions with an aggregate value (e.g., count) above some minimum support threshold. The result of Iceberg-CUBE can be used (1) to answer group-by queries with a clause such as HAVING COUNT(*) {$>$}= X, where X is greater than the threshold, (2) for mining multidimensional association rules, and (3) to complement existing strategies for identifying interesting subsets of the CUBE for precomputation.
We present a new algorithm (BUC) for Iceberg-CUBE computation. BUC builds the CUBE bottom-up; i.e., it builds the CUBE by starting from a group-by on a single attribute, then a group-by on a pair of attributes, then a group-by on three attributes, and so on. This is the opposite of all techniques proposed earlier for computing the CUBE, and has an important practical advantage: BUC avoids computing the larger group-bys that do not meet minimum support. The pruning in BUC is similar to the pruning in the Apriori algorithm for association rules, except that BUC trades some pruning for locality of reference and reduced memory requirements. BUC uses the same pruning strategy when computing sparse, complete CUBEs.
We present a thorough performance evaluation over a broad range of workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that (in contrast to earlier assumptions) minimizing the aggregations or the number of sorts is not the most important aspect of the sparse CUBE problem. The pruning in BUC, combined with an efficient sort method, enables BUC to outperform all previous algorithms for sparse CUBEs, even for computing entire CUBEs, and to dramatically improve Iceberg-CUBE computation.},

  volume = {18},
  issn = {1041-4347},
  abstract = {As OLAP engines are widely used to support multidimensional data analysis, it is desirable to support in data cubes advanced statistical measures, such as regression and filtering, in addition to the traditional simple measures such as count and average. Such new measures allow users to model, smooth, and predict the trends and patterns of data. Existing algorithms for simple distributive and algebraic measures are inadequate for efficient computation of statistical measures in a multidimensional space. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new class of measures, compressible measures, in order to support efficient computation of the statistical models. For compressible measures, we compress each cell into an auxiliary matrix with a size independent of the number of tuples. We can then compute the statistical measures for any data cell from the compressed data of the lower-level cells without accessing the raw data. Time- and space-efficient lossless aggregation formulae are derived for regression and filtering measures. Our analytical and experimental studies show that the resulting system, regression cube, substantially reduces the memory usage and the overall response time for statistical analysis of multidimensional data},

  abstract = {It is well recognized that data cubing often produces huge outputs. Two popular efforts devoted to this problem are (1) iceberg cube, where only significant cells are kept, and (2) closed cube, where a group of cells which preserve roll-up/drill-down semantics are losslessly compressed to one cell. Due to its usability and importance, efficient computation of closed cubes still warrants a thorough study. In this paper, we propose a new measure, called closedness, for efficient closed data cubing. We show that closedness is an algebraic measure and can be computed efficiently and incrementally. Based on closedness measure, we develop an an aggregation-based approach, called C-Cubing (i.e., Closed-Cubing), and integrate it into two successful iceberg cubing algorithms: MM-Cubing and Star-Cubing. Our performance study shows that C-Cubing runs almost one order of magnitude faster than the previous approaches. We further study how the performance of the alternative algorithms of C-Cubing varies w.r.t the properties of the data sets.},

  abstract = {Partitioning a data cube into sets of cells with "similar behavior" often better exposes the semantics in the cube. E.g., if we find that average boots sales in the West 10th store of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year, it signifies something interesting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper, we are interested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube, exploiting regularities present in the cube, with a clear basis. We would like the summary: (i) to be as concise as possible, (ii) to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube, and (iii) to allow the original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem and discuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells for obtaining succinct summaries, and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient algorithms for computing it from a base table. For monotone aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM on non-negative measures, etc.), our solution is optimal (i.e., quotient cube of the least size). For nonmonotone functions (e.g., AVG), we obtain a locally optimal solution. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our ideas and techniques and the scalability of our algorithms.},

  volume = {137},

  abstract = {Sentinel-1A is a 2-ton spacecraft of the Copernicus Earth observation program operated by ESA's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Sentinel-1A and its sister spacecraft Sentinel-1B operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at about 700~km altitude. On 2016/08/23 17:07:37 UTC, Sentinel-1A suffered from an anomaly resulting in a sudden permanent partial power loss and significant impulsive orbit and attitude changes. A deeper investigation identified that an impulsive orbit change against flight direction of 0.7~mm/s, estimated at the time of the event, gave the best results in terms of GPS residuals. At the same time, a peak attitude off-pointing of 0.7\textdegree{} (around the spacecraft yaw axis) and peak attitude rate increase of 0.04\textdegree/s (around the same axis) were observed. The simultaneous occurrence of these anomalies, starting from a sudden attitude change and ending with a permanent partial power loss, made an MMOD (Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris) impact onto a solar array a possible explanation for this event. While the spacecraft is able to continue its mission nominally, a detailed investigation involving ESA's Space Debris and Flight Dynamics experts was conducted. An MMOD impact as an explanation gained further credibility, due to the pictures of the solar array taken by the on-board camera displaying a significant damage area. On September 7th, JSpOC (US Joint Space Operations Centre) informed SDO on 8 tracked fragments that are considered to be released by Sentinel-1A after the impact. This paper addresses the analysis that was performed on the data characterising the attitude and orbit change, the on-board camera image, and the tracked fragments. The data helped to identify the linear momentum vector while a flux analysis helped to identify the origin of the impactor and allowed to understand its mass and size characteristics.},

The objective of this work is to integrate approximation mechanisms and associated operators into data cubes in order to produce views that can then be explored using OLAP or data mining techniques. The integration of data approximation capabilities with OLAP techniques offers additional facilities for cube exploration and analysis. The proposed approach allows the user to work either in a restricted mode using a cube lower approximation or in a relaxed mode using cube upper approximation. The former mode is useful when the query output is large, and hence allows the user to focus on a reduced set of fully matching tuples. The latter is useful when a query returns an empty or small answer set, and hence helps relax the query conditions so that a superset of the answer is returned.},

This technique considers the previously unrecognized case in which multiple Hierarchical Range Queries (HRQ), a very useful class of OLAP queries, must be evaluated against the target data cube simultaneously. This scenario makes traditional data cube compression techniques ineffective, as, contrary to the aim of our work, these techniques take into consideration one constraint only (e.g., a given storage space bound). The result of our study consists in introducing an innovative multiple-objective OLAP computational paradigm, and a hierarchical multidimensional histogram, whose main benefit is meaningfully implementing an intermediate compression of the input data cube able to simultaneously accommodate an even large family of different-in-nature HRQ. A complementary contribution of our work is represented by a wide experimental evaluation of the performance of our technique against both benchmark and real-life data cubes, also in comparison with state-of-the-art histogram-based compression techniques.},

  volume = {122},
  issn = {0950-7051},
  abstract = {Mining association rules plays an important role in decision support systems. To mine strong association rules, it is necessary to mine frequent patterns. There are many algorithms that have been developed to efficiently mine frequent patterns, such as Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth, PrePost, and FIN. However, these are only efficient with a small number of items in the database. When a database has a large number of items (from thousands to hundreds of thousands) but the number of transactions is small, these algorithms cannot run when the minimum support threshold is also small (because the search space is huge). This thus causes the problem of mining colossal patterns in high dimensional databases. In 2012, Sohrabi and Barforoush proposed the BVBUC algorithm for mining colossal patterns based on a bottom-up scheme. However, this needs more time to check subsets and supersets, because it generates a lot of candidates and consumes more memory to store these. In this paper we propose new, efficient algorithms for mining colossal patterns. Firstly, the CP (Colossal Pattern)-tree is designed. Next, we develop two theorems to rapidly compute patterns of nodes and prune nodes without the loss of information in colossal patterns. Based on the CP-tree and these theorems, an algorithm (named CP-Miner) is proposed to solve the problem of mining colossal patterns. A sorting strategy for efficiently mining colossal patterns is thus developed. This strategy helps to reduce the number of significant candidates and the time needed to check subsets and supersets. The PCP-Miner algorithm, which uses this strategy, is then proposed, and we also conduct experiments to show the efficiency of these algorithms.},

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions.

More specifically, the authors seek to answer the following two principal questions: Q1 \textendash{} What are the different types of BD challenges theorized/proposed/confronted by organizations? and Q2 \textendash{} What are the different types of BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed to overcome BD challenges?. This systematic literature review (SLR) is carried out through observing and understanding the past trends and extant patterns/themes in the BDA research area, evaluating contributions, summarizing knowledge, thereby identifying limitations, implications and potential further research avenues to support the academic community in exploring research themes/patterns. Thus, to trace the implementation of BD strategies, a profiling method is employed to analyze articles (published in English-speaking peer-reviewed journals between 1996 and 2015) extracted from the Scopus database. The analysis presented in this paper has identified relevant BD research studies that have contributed both conceptually and empirically to the expansion and accrual of intellectual wealth to the BDA in technology and organizational resource management discipline.},

  abstract = {Earth observation satellites are platforms equipped with optical instruments that orbit the earth to take photographs of specific areas at users' requests. Compared with huge user requests, satellites are still scanty resources. For some task, the satellite has to roll its camera to take the desired image. However, many satellites are rigidly restricted on maneuverability. As a result, the performances of satellites are greatly confined. Therefore, we need a scientific observation plan to weaken the constraints arising from satellites' poor slew ability. To solve the problem we present a multi satellites scheduling algorithm based on task merging mechanism. The algorithm partitions the problem into two sub-problems: task assignment and task merging. In task assignment, we propose an adaptive ant colony optimization algorithm to select specific time window for each task, creating a task list for each satellite. In task merging, we propose the concept of task combination and develop a dynamic programming algorithm to find the best merging plan for each satellite. The two sub-problems are logically coupled; a valid observation plan will be got after much iteration. Finally, a series of test examples are given out, which demonstrate our algorithm to be effective.},

  volume = {70},
  issn = {0148-2963},
  abstract = {Big Data (BD), with their potential to ascertain valued insights for enhanced decision-making process, have recently attracted substantial interest from both academics and practitioners. Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD. The analytics process, including the deployment and use of BDA tools, is seen by organizations as a tool to improve operational efficiency though it has strategic potential, drive new revenue streams and gain competitive advantages over business rivals. However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape. Given the significant nature of the BD and BDA, this paper presents a state-of-the-art review that presents a holistic view of the BD challenges and BDA methods theorized/proposed/employed by organizations to help others understand this landscape with the objective of making robust investment decisions.

The Muon \$g-2\$ experiment at Fermilab is set to measure \$a\_\{\textbackslash{}mu\}\$ with a four-fold improvement in the uncertainty with respect to previous experiment, with an aim to determine whether the \$g-2\$ discrepancy is well established. The experiment recently completed its first physics run and a summer programme of essential upgrades, before continuing on with its experimental programme. The Run-1 data alone are expected to yield a statistical uncertainty of 350 ppb and the publication of the first result is expected in late-2019.},
