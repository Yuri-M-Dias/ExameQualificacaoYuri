Until now, the impacts of such exposures have only been studied in animals after acute exposures, using dose rates {$\sim$}1.5\texttimes 105 higher than those actually encountered in space. Using a new, low dose-rate neutron irradiation facility, we have uncovered that realistic, low dose-rate exposures produce serious neurocognitive complications associated with impaired neurotransmission. Chronic (6 month) low-dose (18 cGy) and dose rate (1 mGy/d) exposures of mice to a mixed field of neutrons and photons result in diminished hippocampal neuronal excitability and disrupted hippocampal and cortical long-term potentiation. Furthermore, mice displayed severe impairments in learning and memory, and the emergence of distress behaviors. Behavioral analyses showed an alarming increase in risk associated with these realistic simulations, revealing for the first time, some unexpected potential problems associated with deep space travel on all levels of neurological function.},

In particular, helicopters and other targets with rotors, as for instance miniature Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, exhibit peculiar characteristics in the radar return that can be used for their recognition. In this paper a novel algorithm to address the problem of micro-Doppler signature unmixing is proposed, exploiting the signal separation capabilities of the Independent Component Analysis (ICA). The core of the algorithm is represented precisely by the use of the ICA procedure, that has been already proved to be a very effective technique for separating hidden information in mixtures of observations. ICA has been successfully employed in several applications such as wireless communications, radar beamforming, trace-gases unmixing and medical imaging processing. The helicopter's rotor blade signature unmixing from a multi-static radar system is considered as case study and results obtained through the application of ICA to simulated multi-component micro-Doppler signatures show the capability of the proposed approach to successfully accomplish the unmixing operation.},

  abstract = {Given a sequence T = t0t1 . . . tn-1 of size n = |T|, with symbols from a fixed alphabet {$\Sigma$}, (|{$\Sigma$}| {$\leq$} n), the suffix array provides a listing of all the suffixes of T in a lexicographic order. Given T, the suffix sorting problem is to construct its suffix array. The direct suffix sorting problem is to construct the suffix array of T directly without using the suffix tree data structure. While algorithims for linear time, linear space direct suffix sorting have been proposed, the actual constant in the linear space is still a major concern, given that the applications of suffix trees and suffix arrays (such as in whole-genome analysis) often involve huge data sets. In this work, we reduce the gap between current results and the minimal space requirement. We introduce an algorithm for the direct suffix sorting problem with worst case time complexity in O(n), requiring only   (1 2 3  n log n - n log | {$\sum$} |+O(1))  bits in memory space. This implies   5 2 3  n+O(1)  bytes for total space requirment, (including space for both the output suffix array and the input sequence T) assuming   n {$\leq$}   2  32  ,| {$\sum$} |{$\leq$}256 , and 4 bytes per integer. The basis of our algorithm is an extension of Shannon-Fano-Elias codes used in source coding and information theory. This is the first time information-theoretic methods have been used as the basis for solving the suffix sorting problem.},

However, the importance of considering SET in Very-Large-System-Integration (VLSI) circuits increases given the reduction of the transistor dimensions and the logic data path depth in advanced technology nodes. Accordingly, the threat of SET in electronics systems for space applications must be carefully addressed along with the SEU characterization. In this work, a systematic prediction methodology to assess and improve the SET immunity of digital circuits is presented. Further, the applicability to full-custom and cell-based design methodologies are discussed, and an analysis based on signal probability and pin assignment is proposed to achieve a more application-efficient SET-aware optimization of synthesized circuits. For instance, a SET-aware pin assignment can provide a reduction of 37\% and 16\% on the SET rate of a NOR gate for a Geostationary Orbit (GEO) and the International Space Station (ISS) orbit, respectively.},

This paper develops a hierarchical modeling methodology for open cyber-physical systems that combines techniques in estimation theory with those in data mining to reliably capture complex system behavior at different levels of abstraction. Our technique is also novel in the sense that it provides a measure of confidence in predictions. An application to green transportation is discussed, where the goal is to reduce vehicular fuel consumption and carbon footprint. First-principle models of cyber-physical systems can be very complex and include a large number of parameters, whereas empirical regression models are often unreliable when a high number of parameters is involved. Our new modeling technique, called the Sparse Regression Cube, simultaneously (i) partitions sparse, high-dimensional measurements into subspaces within which reliable linear regression models apply and (ii) determines the best reliable model for each partition, quantifying uncertainty in output prediction. Evaluation results show that the framework significantly improves modeling accuracy compared to previous approaches and correctly quantifies prediction error, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.},

  abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are an advanced technology that satisfies most requirements of a space mission. Due to the high cost of satellites and their launch and operation processes, satellite batteries are expected to operate until the end of a satellite's life. Since the batteries are the core part of the power system, a battery failure would not only affect the system's normal functionality and performance, which would lead to increased system downtime, but could also lead to catastrophic events. To ensure that the batteries are reliable, efficient, and capable of delivering power and energy when required, an accurate prediction of the battery's performance, health, and life is necessary. In this paper, we estimate the remaining useful life (RUL) of a battery by using a pattern-based machine learning and knowledge discovery approach called Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). We propose a reliability-based prognostic methodology that uses condition monitoring (CM) data, which can deal with any number of condition indicators without selecting the most significant ones, as many other machine learning methods propose. The LAD approach is based on an exploration of the monitored battery's database and the extraction of useful information, which describe the phenomenon of battery's degradation. The diagnostic information, which is updated each time new data is gathered, is combined with the nonparametric Kaplan Meier (KM) estimation method to estimate the RUL of a monitored battery working under different operating conditions.},

The management of big data in a continuously expanding network gives rise to non-trivial concerns regarding data collection efficiency, data processing, analytics, and security. To address these concerns, researchers have examined the challenges associated with the successful deployment of IoT. Despite the large number of studies on big data, analytics, and IoT, the convergence of these areas creates several opportunities for flourishing big data and analytics for IoT systems. In this paper, we explore the recent advances in big data analytics for IoT systems as well as the key requirements for managing big data and for enabling analytics in an IoT environment. We taxonomized the literature based on important parameters. We identify the opportunities resulting from the convergence of big data, analytics, and IoT as well as discuss the role of big data analytics in IoT applications.

However, these swift changes have, at the same time, posed challenges to data mining applications, in particular efficient association rule mining. Many data mining algorithms for high-dimensional datasets have been put forward, but the sheer numbers of these algorithms with varying features and application scenarios have complicated making suitable choices. Therefore, we present a general survey of multiple association rule mining algorithms applicable to high-dimensional datasets. The main characteristics and relative merits of these algorithms are explained, as well, pointing out areas for improvement and optimization strategies that might be better adapted to high-dimensional datasets, according to previous studies. Generally speaking, association rule mining algorithms that merge diverse optimization methods with advanced computer techniques can better balance scalability and interpretability.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at identifying retrofitting possibilities to incorporate existing spacecraft into a network of federated satellite systems. The paper presents a systematic review of possible retrofitting options, such as direct modifications including replacement and addition of interfaces, and indirect modifications through the addition of intermediary federated negotiators. The paper considers existing frequency regulations for the analysis in the technical domain, but does not take into consideration how complex or time-consuming any legislative changes might be. Although the paper concludes that direct modifications of existing satellites are nonfeasible from a technical point of view, it identifies a possible scenario of retrofitting by adding intermediary negotiator satellites. The link budget for the intersatellite link between an existing satellite mission, such as SPOT-6, and a conceptual satellite negotiator was estimated. The work concludes that from a link budget point of view and existing technology, such a configuration can provide a slant range from several hundred to thousands of kilometers. The work defines models for trade-off analysis identifying correlations between satellite negotiator parameters and the number of covered satellites. The paper concludes proposing several possible satellite negotiator architectures and high-level technical requirements based on analysis of characteristics of existing and planned satellites.},

We present adaptive algorithms that make no a priori assumptions about the problem instance, and show that their running times are within a constant factor of optimal with respect to a natural measure of the difficulty of an instance. In the process, we develop a framework for designing and evaluating adaptive algorithms in the comparison model.},

This paper presents an OLAP tool named Falseto (Former AnalyticaL Sessions for lEss Tedious Olap), that is meant to assist query and session composition, by letting the user summarize, browse, query, and reuse former analytical sessions. Falseto's implementation on top of a formal framework is detailed. We also report the experiments we run to obtain and analyze real OLAP sessions and assess Falseto with them.

  abstract = {When planning planetary rover missions it is useful to develop intuition and skills driving in, quite literally, alien environments before incurring the cost of reaching said locales. Simulators make it possible to operate in environments that have the physical characteristics of target locations without the expense and overhead of extensive physical tests. To that end, NASA Ames and Open Robotics collaborated on a Lunar rover driving simulator based on the open source Gazebo simulation platform and leveraging ROS (Robotic Operating System)components. The simulator was integrated with research and mission software for rover driving, system monitoring, and science instrument simulation to constitute an end-to-end Lunar mission simulation capability. Although we expect our simulator to be applicable to arbitrary Lunar regions, we designed to a reference mission of prospecting in polar regions. The harsh lighting and low illumination angles at the Lunar poles combine with the unique reflectance properties of Lunar regolith to present a challenging visual environment for both human and computer perception. Our simulator placed an emphasis on high fidelity visual simulation in order to produce synthetic imagery suitable for evaluating human rover drivers with navigation tasks, as well as providing test data for computer vision software development. In this paper, we describe the software used to construct the simulated Lunar environment and the components of the driving simulation. Our synthetic terrain generation software artificially increases the resolution of Lunar digital elevation maps by fractal synthesis and inserts craters and rocks based on Lunar size-frequency distribution models. We describe the necessary enhancements to import large scale, high resolution terrains into Gazebo, as well as our approach to modeling the visual environment of the Lunar surface. An overview of the mission software system is provided, along with how ROS was used to emulate flight software components that had not been developed yet. Finally, we discuss the effect of using the high-fidelity synthetic Lunar images for visual odometry. We also characterize the wheel slip model, and find some inconsistencies in the produced wheel slip behavior.},

In this paper, we propose a data warehouse design for handling GPS data, fuel consumption data, and weather data. The design is fully implemented in a running system using the PostgreSQL DBMS. The system has been in production since March 2011 and the main fact table contains today approximately 3.4 billion rows from 16 different data sources. We show that the system can be used for a number of novel traffic related analyses such as relating the fuel consumption of vehicles with the road network and road congestion.},

For avoid accessing the unnecessary closed nodes in disk, in this paper, we propose an optimized algorithm named Q-Dwarf. The property of this algorithm guarantees that once the closed nodes are written to disk, they will not be read out again, and query algorithm and update algorithm are both based on files.

The Frontier Radio, developed by JHU/APL, has been used for traditional Earth-to-spacecraft communication links and has now been enhanced to implement relay communications between two Frontier Radios for use on Europa missions. NASA has been studying a future Europa Lander mission, one variation of which required relay links to a Carrier and Relay Stage (CRS) as well as to the Europa Clipper spacecraft. The relay communications are at X-band, using the same Frontier Radio already in use for direct-to-Earth (DTE) communications. By exploiting the software-defined nature of the Frontier Radio, a new software protocol ``relay personality'' was created for relay communications. The process of relay-session establishment, loss of lock actions, and emergency communications contingencies are discussed here. The radios each perform self-acquisition by internally sweeping their receivers to lock onto the incoming signal and has a feature to implement Doppler predicts instead of relying on a ground station to sweep the uplink signal frequency as in DTE links. The protocol leverages the existing flight computer/ command and data handling (C\&DH) similar to the DTE links. The concept of operations (CONOPS) for the Europa relay links nominally uses scheduled passes preloaded from contact parameter tables, but unscheduled passes are also supported where either node can initiate. These protocols and processes were implemented in flight software running on a Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) core located in the radio's field programmable gate array (FPGA). The constraints imposed on the design of the relay communications and the current implementation of this relay protocol is covered in this paper.},

  abstract = {In data warehousing, selecting a subset of views for materialization has been widely employed as a way to reduce the query evaluation time for real-time OLAP queries. However, materialization of a large number of views may be counterproductive and may exceed storage thresholds, especially when considering very large data warehouses. Thus, an important concern is to find the best set of views to materialize, in order to guarantee acceptable query response times. It further follows that the best set of views may change, as the query histories evolve. To address these issues, we introduce the Smart Cube algorithm that combines vertical partitioning, partial materialization and dynamic computation. In our approach, we partition the search space into fragments and proceed to select the optimal subset of fragments to materialize. We dynamically adapt the set of materialized views that we store, as based on query histories. The experimental evaluation of our Smart Cube algorithm shows that our work compare favorably with the state-of-the-art. The results indicate that our algorithm materializes a smaller number of views than other techniques, while yielding fast query response times.},

As a case study, we implemented an application where users can upload data and immediately navigate through its ad hoc dimensions. To support social networking, views can be easily shared and embedded in other Web sites. Algorithmically, our tag-cloud views are approximate range top-k queries over spontaneous data cubes. We present experimental evidence that iceberg cuboids provide adequate online approximations. We benchmark several browser-oblivious tag-cloud layout optimizations.},

  publisher = {{CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform}},
  abstract = {This book provides a basic, conceptual-level description of engineering management disciplines that relate to the development and life cycle management of a system. For the non-engineer it provides an overview of how a system is developed. For the engineer and project manager it provides a basic framework for planning and assessing system development. Information in the book is from various sources, but a good portion is taken from lecture material developed for the two Systems Planning, Research, Development, and Engineering courses offered by the Defense Acquisition University. The book is divided into four parts: Introduction; Systems Engineering Process; Systems Analysis and Control; and Planning, Organizing, and Managing. The first part introduces the basic concepts that govern the systems engineering process and how those concepts fit the Department of Defense acquisition process. Chapter 1 establishes the basic concept and introduces terms that will be used throughout the book. The second chapter goes through a typical acquisition life cycle showing how systems engineering supports acquisition decision making. The second part introduces the systems engineering problem-solving process, and discusses in basic terms some traditional techniques used in the process. An overview is given, and then the process of requirements analysis, functional analysis and allocation, design synthesis, and verification is explained in some detail. This part ends with a discussion of the documentation developed as the finished output of the systems engineering process. Part three discusses analysis and control tools that provide balance to the process. Key activities (such as risk management, configuration management, and trade studies) that support and run parallel to the system engineering process are identified and explained. Part four discusses issues integral to the conduct of a systems engineering effort, from planning to consideration of broader management issues. In some chapters supplementary sections provide related material that shows common techniques or policy-driven processes. These expand the basic conceptual discussion, but give the student a clearer picture of what systems engineering means in a real acquisition environment.},

The effort consists in developing a Brazilian CubeSat platform that can be industrialized in Brazil and takes advantage of a Systems Engineering Process approach. This Systems Engineering Process applied on the CubeSat includes mission and life-cycle analysis, requirements engineering, functional analysis, architecture design, and uses an operation life-cycle scenario as an example. The approach is supposed to be applied to every life-cycle process. Thus, System Engineering Process gives a wide range view of the problem, guiding engineers to develop product and organization solutions throughout life-cycle. This approach helps to solve technical and management issues that sometimes are not encompassed with just experienced staff and standard methods.},

This paper describes such a distributed computing architecture and its operational design in the form of command and data handling system and telemetry formulation, adapted for a CubeSat whose power requirements for proving the mission are significantly larger than the on-orbit average power generated. The 1U CubeSat with the mission objective of precision three axes attitude control is composed of a low power flight computer and a high power, high speed auxiliary processor (CMG controller), along with a high capacity battery. The precision sensors, actuators and complex computing algorithms, are interfaced and implemented on the high speed auxiliary processor, which is operated intermittently. Health monitoring sensors, transceiver and other housekeeping tasks are interfaced and implemented on the flight computer, which is in continuous operation. To facilitate effective operation and telemetry packaging, each computing unit is designed to host a storage device. The flight software, designed as operating modes, is distributed across the two computing platforms. Distributed operations are initiated through the flight computer and executed on the auxiliary processor. The paper describes in detail the distributed design of these operating modes as flowcharts and the associated telemetry budget as tables.},

  abstract = {Automated planning and scheduling, sometimes denoted as simply AI Planning, is a branch of artificial intelligence that concerns the realization of strategies or action sequences, typically for execution by intelligent agents, autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles. Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimized in multidimensional space. Planning is also related to decision theory. In known environments with available models, planning can be done offline. Solutions can be found and evaluated prior to execution. In dynamically unknown environments, the strategy often needs to be revised online. Models and policies must be adapted. Solutions usually resort to iterative trial and error processes commonly seen in artificial intelligence. These include dynamic programming, reinforcement learning and combinatorial optimization. Languages used to describe planning and scheduling are often called action languages.},

  abstract = {Data cube is a multi-dimensional structure of data representation used in data warehousing, which is analyzed using Online Analytical Process(OLAP). However, OLAP in itself is incapable of intelligent analysis in terms of generating a compact and useful data cube as well as lacks the power of predicting empty measures in data cube. Recently statistical methods have been applied for compact cube generation and prediction of empty measures in data cube. In this paper we reviewed and critically evaluated the available work done in this area. Literature review highlighted that sparsity, data redundancy and need of domain knowledge are problems in the way of intelligent analysis. Statistical methods have solved these issues in schema generation, compact cube generation and in prediction of empty measures of data cube individually. Methodology to solve these problems and then to perform an intelligent analysis has not yet been developed. In order to develop such an integrated methodology, we propose a conceptual model for intelligent analysis of data cube via statistical methods in the first stage. This model is integrating statistical methods used in generating a compact cube with a prediction mechanism. Our next target is to develop this model into a complete methodology.},

  abstract = {Data cubes are multi-dimensional structures that consist of dimensions and measures. Analysts can view the performance measures via different perspectives provided by the available dimensions in data cubes. However, modeling of these meaningful dimensions and selection of informative measure is a difficult task for human data warehouse developers. In high dimensional environments, the sheer size and volume of data poses a number of challenges in order to generate meaningful data cubes. Nowadays, there is a growing requirement of automated and intelligent techniques that allows analysts to construct and explore the large cubes for better decision making. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature on intelligent data cubes construction and exploration. Literature review reveals that a number of techniques have been proposed to embed intelligence in data cubes. However, majority of the previously proposed technique targeted either on providing intelligence in cube construction or focused assisting the intelligent exploration of data cubes. However, there is very limited amount of work has been done in the integration of intelligent techniques for both cube construction and exploration. We believe that it is a strong area of research and the modern analytical systems demand the availability of intelligent techniques for both construction and exploration of large data cubes for making intelligent decisions. The objective of this paper is to present a critical review of the existing techniques and to propose a conceptual model that not only overcomes the individual limitations in the previous work but also merges the benefits of intelligent construction and exploration of cubes in parallel. However, the implementation of the proposed model is beyond the scope of this paper.},

We present the worst and average case analysis, showing that in the former, the complexity nicely adapts to the smallest list size. In the latter case, it performs less comparisons than the total number of elements on both inputs, n and m, when n = {$\alpha$}m ({$\alpha$} {$>$} 1), achieving O(m log(n/m)) complexity. The algorithm is motivated by its application to fast query processing in Web search engines, where large intersections, or differences, must be performed fast. In this case we experimentally show that the algorithm is faster than previous solutions.},

The NASA Radioisotope Power Systems (RPS) Program Mission Analysis Team gathered information on past and recent RPS mission concept studies by various organizations in the United States to support the Next-Generation RTG Study in crystalizing an understanding of mission ``pull'' that is crucial to define requirements for a potential next generation of RTGs. This paper describes the top-down processes and findings that helped establish a reasonable set of draft requirements for a potential Next-Generation RTG, which are documented in the Next-Generation RTG Study final report. To perform the required mission analyses, and to combine data and present the results in a unique way, an extensive relational database was developed. The database includes detailed data for 63 targets, six generic potential destinations (comet, Trojan, Centaur, etc.), 142 spacecraft concepts (65 launched and 77 studied), and 249 missions associated with these spacecraft concepts. In total, 77 RPS-powered spacecraft and associated mission concept studies were gathered, evaluated and assessed for the Next-Generation RTG Study. A number of spacecraft are associated with a number of mission concept types/subtypes at different destinations; thus, in this report, a mission is defined as a unique vector of spacecraft, mission concept type (e.g., lander) /subtype (e.g., rover), and target. For example, Cassini conducted flybys of Enceladus and 2685 Masursky, and orbited Saturn, which is considered three missions under this definition. Furthermore, there are two categories of spacecraft concepts: launched missions (e.g., Cassini, Mars Science Laboratory [MSL]) and concepts studied for possible future missions.},

Unstructured data refers to information that either does not have a pre-defined data model or does not fit well into relational tables. Unstructured data is the fastest growing type of data, some example could be imagery, sensors, telemetry, video, documents, log files, and email data files. There are several techniques to address this problem space of unstructured analytics. The techniques share a common characteristics of scale-out, elasticity and high availability. MapReduce, in conjunction with the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and HBase database, as part of the Apache Hadoop project is a modern approach to analyze unstructured data. Hadoop clusters are an effective means of processing massive volumes of data, and can be improved with the right architectural approach.},

In this work, we generalize this theoretical model to the multi-partite setting of barcode decoding and pattern recognition. We start by defining a digital image as an array or grid of pixels, each pixel corresponding to an ensemble of quantum channels. Specializing each pixel to a black and white alphabet, we naturally define an optical model of barcode. In this scenario, we show that the use of quantum entangled sources, combined with suitable measurements and data processing, greatly outperforms classical coherent-state strategies for the tasks of barcode data decoding and classification of black and white patterns. Moreover, introducing relevant bounds, we show that the problem of pattern recognition is significantly simpler than barcode decoding, as long as the minimum Hamming distance between images from different classes is large enough. Finally, we theoretically demonstrate the advantage of using quantum sensors for pattern recognition with the nearest neighbor classifier, a supervised learning algorithm, and numerically verify this prediction for handwritten digit classification.},

  abstract = {The implementation of condition-based maintenance continues to face several challenges especially in the aeronautics field. While it is true that time-based maintenance dominates the industry today, it is believed that condition monitoring could yield promising results with a better compromise on cost over effectiveness in the long run. The aim of condition-based monitoring in aeronautics is, based on the available system data (e.g., flight, event and maintenance data), to evaluate the current health state of an aircraft component and to estimate its remaining useful life. Several approaches have been studied in condition-based maintenance with the most promising being data-driven modeling. This paper proposes a comparison of a set of data-driven modeling techniques to perform prognostics on a critical component of the jet engine bleed system. The novelty of our work is twofold. First, we perform this comparative study on a real case study of a critical valve of the aircraft bleed system. Fielded data from different data sources are used in the models. To our knowledge, this is the first case study that merges data from the computer central maintenance system (fault messages), maintenance data, and flight data on a prognostics system. Second, a variety of data-driven techniques are compared from neural nets to regression support machines. The models are compared using the standard metrics of absolute, mean, and squared errors. A regressive accuracy curve is also used to compare the models along different prediction window sizes. The results show the best model comprised information from all data sources. The data that most contributed to the performance improvement was the maintenance, flight and fault data, in this order. This result comes to reinforce the notion that it is more difficult to extract quantitative information from fault events than flight data with data-driven regressive methods.},

  abstract = {Anomaly detection is an active area of research with numerous methods and applications. This survey reviews the state-of-the-art of data-driven anomaly detection techniques and their application to the aviation domain. After a brief introduction to the main traditional data-driven methods for anomaly detection, we review the recent advances in the area of neural networks, deep learning and temporal-logic based learning. In particular, we cover unsupervised techniques applicable to time series data because of their relevance to the aviation domain, where the lack of labeled data is the most usual case, and the nature of flight trajectories and sensor data is sequential, or temporal. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are presented in terms of computational efficiency and detection efficacy. The second part of the survey explores the application of anomaly detection techniques to aviation and their contributions to the improvement of the safety and performance of flight operations and aviation systems. As far as we know, some of the presented methods have not yet found an application in the aviation domain. We review applications ranging from the identification of significant operational events in air traffic operations to the prediction of potential aviation system failures for predictive maintenance.},

  abstract = {Weight, lift, drag and thrust are the key forces during flight influencing the consumption characteristics of an aircraft. Monitoring the aircraft's fuel consumption allows statements to be made about the aircraft performance and flight efficiency. Here, valuations with regard to a propulsive or an aerodynamic degrading as well as procedural benefits are of interest for aircraft operators and airlines. Conventional data analyses and calculation methods (ex post), e. g. via physical models or statistical metrics like median or mean, have the disadvantage of not being able to quantify influencing parameters on the fuel economy accurately enough in many cases. A more precise method, which allows statements and assessments (diagnoses based on historical flight data) and estimations (prognoses based on estimated model inputs) on the aircraft fuel consumption, would be desirable to detect aircraft fuel and flight (in)efficiencies under real flight operational and environmental conditions. In this respect, a reliable trade off would be desirable in order to avoid uneconomical modeling effort and reduce expenses concerning data procurement. This paper is in the scope of an application-oriented machine learning method development. For this reason, the present work deals with algorithms of machine learning, which can exceed current methods, especially for complex tasks with multivariate interdependencies. Ensembles of bagged decision trees for regression and classification purposes, as well as hierarchical cluster analyses applied on full flight data records from flight operations. Thus, the paper addresses two objectives and provides first approaches for: modeling of route, environment and aircraft (tail sign) specific characteristics for feasible fuel flow predictions on the one hand (diagnosis and prognosis in the field of data science); data-based analyses and quantification of influencing factors on the fuel economy to identify routes and anomalous flights on the other hand (data mining, pattern recognition). The latter, thus, aims at an improvement of reporting and the derivation of recommendations for actions for future flight profiles. Finally, the analysis capability of the concept is shown with first results for two analysis questions with three examples, evaluated based on an analysis with sample flight data provided by NASA Dashlink. To proof and evaluate the applicability of this method, a benchmark is also presented by using an available (physical) performance model and statistical metrics.},

  abstract = {Recently a great deal of attention has focused on quantum computation following a sequence of results suggesting that quantum computers are more powerful than classical probabilistic computers. Following Shor's result that factoring and the extraction of discrete logarithms are both solvable in quantum polynomial time, it is natural to ask whether all of NP can be efficiently solved in quantum polynomial time. In this paper, we address this question by proving that relative to an oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class NP cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time \$o(2\^\{n/2\})\$. We also show that relative to a permutation oracle chosen uniformly at random, with probability 1, the class \$NP \textbackslash cap coNP\$ cannot be solved on a quantum Turing machine in time \$o(2\^\{n/3\})\$. The former bound is tight since recent work of Grover shows how to accept the class NP relative to any oracle on a quantum computer in time \$O(2\^\{n/2\})\$.},

  abstract = {Routing in Delay-/Disruption-Tolerant Networking (DTN) requires specific solutions as link impairments prevent the use of ordinary Internet algorithms, based on a timely dissemination of network topology information. Among DTN routing algorithms there is a dichotomy between opportunistic and deterministic (scheduled) solutions. The former are numerous and apply to terrestrial environments; CGR is the most widely supported algorithm designed for scheduled connectivity, and it is usually applied to space networks. However, in an attempt to provide a unified approach, an opportunistic variant of CGR, Opportunistic CGR (OCGR) has been recently proposed by some of the authors. Performance evaluations are normally carried out for opportunistic solutions by means of simulators, such as The ONE considered in this paper. CGR by contrast is more often studied by means of small testbeds. As the simulation approach could be complementary for CGR, and essential for OCGR, the authors have recently ported both of them into The ONE, by developing and releasing as free software a specific additional package. The aim of this paper is to show the rationale of this choice and discuss the many challenges that needed to be tackled to achieve this primary goal.},

The work of spacecraft navigation involves rigorous requirements for accuracy and completeness, often carried out under uncompromising critical time pressures. Robust and fault tolerant design for the ground data system is crucial for the numerous space missions we support, from the Mars rover Curiosity to Cassini in orbit around Saturn. We begin by examining the design principles learned from fault tolerant design efforts to protect against random failure, and consider computer security engineering as a derivative effort to protect against intelligent actors promoting malicious failure. Examples for best practices of reliable system design from computer and aviation industry are considered and security fault tolerance principles are derived from this effort. Computer security design approaches are reviewed, both as abstract principles (starting from cornerstones in Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability) and from implementation. Strategic design principles such as defense in depth, least privilege, and vulnerability removal are used in this design. We evaluate system design from external access data flows, through internal host security mechanisms, and finally to user access controls. A complementary intersection - the balance between the protection of the system and promoting its ease of use by engineers (making their experience as user friendly and efficient as possible) is evaluated. Finally, we consider future refinements to secure system architecture.},

  abstract = {We introduce the Iceberg-CUBE problem as a reformulation of the datacube (CUBE) problem. The Iceberg-CUBE problem is to compute only those group-by partitions with an aggregate value (e.g., count) above some minimum support threshold. The result of Iceberg-CUBE can be used (1) to answer group-by queries with a clause such as HAVING COUNT(*) {$>$}= X, where X is greater than the threshold, (2) for mining multidimensional association rules, and (3) to complement existing strategies for identifying interesting subsets of the CUBE for precomputation. We present a new algorithm (BUC) for Iceberg-CUBE computation. BUC builds the CUBE bottom-up; i.e., it builds the CUBE by starting from a group-by on a single attribute, then a group-by on a pair of attributes, then a group-by on three attributes, and so on. This is the opposite of all techniques proposed earlier for computing the CUBE, and has an important practical advantage: BUC avoids computing the larger group-bys that do not meet minimum support. The pruning in BUC is similar to the pruning in the Apriori algorithm for association rules, except that BUC trades some pruning for locality of reference and reduced memory requirements. BUC uses the same pruning strategy when computing sparse, complete CUBEs. We present a thorough performance evaluation over a broad range of workloads. Our evaluation demonstrates that (in contrast to earlier assumptions) minimizing the aggregations or the number of sorts is not the most important aspect of the sparse CUBE problem. The pruning in BUC, combined with an efficient sort method, enables BUC to outperform all previous algorithms for sparse CUBEs, even for computing entire CUBEs, and to dramatically improve Iceberg-CUBE computation.},

We take advantage of the existence of very large virtual memories, and quite large real memories, to make the technique feasible. We maintain the database as a strongly typed data structure in virtual memory, record updates incrementally on disk in a log and occasionally make a checkpoint of the entire database. We recover from crashes by restoring the database from an old checkpoint then replaying the log. We use existing packages to convert between strongly typed data objects and their disk representations, and to communicate strongly typed data across the network (using remote procedure calls). Our memory is managed entirely by a general purpose allocator and garbage collector.This scheme has been used to implement a name server for a distributed system. The resulting implementation has the desirable property of being simultaneously simple, efficient and reliable.},

To our knowledge, this is the first work that explores not only the correlations of GOES X-ray and proton channels, but also the correlations that happen across all the proton channels. We found that proton channels autocorrelations and cross-correlations may also be precursors to the occurrence of an SEP event.

Tables, text, and numbers represent the way we communicate, but graph layouts and images represent, more efficiently, the way we think and mind map problems.

Human intelligence as we will show is not based solely on logical operations and computation, but also includes a long list of other characteristics that are unique to humans, which is the ground that supporters of the Singularity ignore. The list includes curiosity, imagination, intuition, emotions, passion, desires, pleasure, aesthetics, joy, purpose, objectives, goals, telos, values, morality, experience, wisdom, judgment, and even humor.},

Several efforts were devoted to this problem through closed cubes, where cells preserving aggregation semantics are losslessly reduced to one cell. In this paper, we introduce the concept of closed non derivable data cube, denoted CNDCND\textbackslash mathcal\{CND\} - CC\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}ube, which generalizes the notion of bi-dimensional frequent closed non derivable patterns to the multidimensional context. We propose a novel algorithm to mine CNDCND\textbackslash mathcal\{CND\} - CC\textbackslash mathcal\{C\}ube from multidimensional databases considering three anti-monotone constraints, namely ``to be frequent'', ``to be non derivable'' and ``to be minimal generator''. Experiments show that our proposal provides the smallest representation of a data cube and thus is the most efficient for saving storage space.},

Several efforts were devoted to this problem through Constrained Cubes allowing the user to focus on a particular set of interesting tuples. In this paper, we investigate reduced representations for the Constrained Cube (e.g., Constrained Closed Cube and Constrained Quotient Cube). That is why we introduce a new and concise representation of data cubes: the Constrained Closed Non Derivable Data Cube (CCND - Cube). The latter captures all the tuples of a data cube fulfilling a combination of monotone/anti-monotone constraints. It can be represented in a very compact way in order to optimize both computation time and required storage space. The results of our experiments confirm the relevance of our proposal.},

Our experimental results prove that a significant improvement and efficiency is achieved using our suggested approach in comparison with those fitting in the same trend.},

  abstract = {We present the data reduction pipeline for CHARIS, a high-contrast integral-field spectrograph for the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from the raw reads using the measured nonlinear pixel response, and reconstructs the data cube using one of three extraction algorithms: aperture photometry, optimal extraction, or \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ fitting. We measure and apply both a detector flatfield and a lenslet flatfield and reconstruct the wavelength- and position-dependent lenslet point-spread function (PSF) from images taken with a tunable laser. We use these measured PSFs to implement a \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$-based extraction of the data cube, with typical residuals of \textasciitilde 5\% due to imperfect models of the undersampled lenslet PSFs. The full two-dimensional residual of the \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ extraction allows us to model and remove correlated read noise, dramatically improving CHARIS' performance. The \$\textbackslash chi\^2\$ extraction produces a data cube that has been deconvolved with the line-spread function, and never performs any interpolations of either the data or the individual lenslet spectra. The extracted data cube also includes uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. CHARIS' software is parallelized, written in Python and Cython, and freely available on github with a separate documentation page. Astrometric and spectrophotometric calibrations of the data cubes and PSF subtraction will be treated in a forthcoming paper.},

We show that the proposed pipeline is superior in accuracy to the models currently used by MEX's operators.

  abstract = {The dark energy plus cold dark matter (\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 1\$ Mpc and mass scales smaller than \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{11\} M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark-matter dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than naively predicted in \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM: Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both will be required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over then next decade. These efforts will either further verify the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter.},

  abstract = {On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) dimensions are usually modeled as a set of elements connected by a hierarchical relationship. To ensure summarizability, a dimension is required to be strict, that is, every element of the dimension must have a unique ancestor in each of its ancestor categories. In practice, elements in a dimension are often reclassified, meaning that their rollups are changed. After this operation the dimension may become non-strict. To fix this problem, we propose to compute a set of minimal r-repairs for the new non-strict dimension. Each minimal r-repair is a strict dimension that keeps the result of the reclassification, and is obtained by performing a minimum number of insertions and deletions to the dimension graph. We show that, although in the general case finding an r-repair is NP-complete, for real-world hierarchy schemas, computing such repairs can be done in polynomial time. Further, we propose efficient heuristic-based algorithms for computing r-repairs, and discuss their computational complexity. We also perform experiments over synthetic and real-world dimensions to show the plausibility of our approach.},

  abstract = {Stellar engines, megastructures used to control the motion of a star system, may be constructible by technologically advanced civilizations and used to avoid dangerous astrophysical events or transport a star system into proximity with another for colonization. This work considers two designs for stellar engines, for both human applications in the solar system and for advanced civilizations around arbitrary stars more generally, and presents analytic calculations of the maximum acceleration and deflection of a star in its galactic orbit. The first is a large `passive' solar sail, similar to that proposed by Shkadov, which we find produces accelerations of order 10-12m/s2 for sun-like stars. The second `active' engine uses a thermonuclear driven jet, as in a Bussard ramjet, which collects matter from the solar wind to drive He fusion. This engine requires additional mass to be lifted from the sun, beyond what is provided by the nascent solar wind, but may achieve accelerations up to 10-9m/s2 producing deflections of 10 pc in as little as 1 Myr for a sun-like star. While passive engines may be insufficient for catastrophe avoidance on short timescales, they can produce arbitrary deflections of a star in its galactic orbit over a stellar lifetime. Active engines are sufficient for retrograde galactic orbits or galactic escape trajectories, which we argue are useful to expansionist civilizations. These populations of stars may be candidates for observationally detecting megastructures.},

Telemetry from solid-state power amplifiers and amplifier thermistors from 32 geostationary Earth orbit communications satellites from 1991 to 2015 are examined. Transient event detection and change-point event detection techniques that use a sliding window-based median are used, statistically evaluating the telemetry stream compared to the local norm. This approach allows application of the algorithms to any spacecraft platform because there is no reliance in the algorithms on satellite- or component-specific parameters, and it does not require a priori knowledge about the data distribution. Individual telemetry data streams are analyzed with the event detection algorithms, resulting in a compiled list of unusual events for each satellite. This approach identifies up to six events of up to six events that affect 51 of 53 telemetry streams at once, indicative of a spacecraft system-level event. In two satellites, the same top event date (4 December 2008) occurs over more than 10 years of telemetry from both satellites. Of the five spacecraft with known maneuvers, the algorithms identify the maneuvers in all cases. Event dates are compared to known operational activities, space weather events, and available anomaly lists to assess the use of event detection algorithms for spacecraft monitoring and sensing of the space environment.},

Several hundreds of CubeSats have already been successfully launched in the past few years and the number of announced launches grows every year. These platforms provide an easy access to space for universities and organizations which otherwise could not afford it. However, these spacecraft still rely on RF communications, where the spectrum is already crowded and cannot support the growing demand for data transmission to the ground. Lasercom holds the promise to be the solution to this problem, with a potential improvement of several orders of magnitude in the transmission capacity, while keeping a low size, weight and power. Between 2016 and 2017, The Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS), a joint institute of the California Institute of Technology and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, brought together a group of space scientists and lasercom engineers to address the current challenges that this technology faces, in order to enable it to compete with RF and eventually replace it when high-data rate is needed. After two one-week workshops, the working group started developing a report addressing three study cases: low Earth orbit, crosslinks and deep space. This paper presents the main points and conclusions of these KISS workshops.},

  abstract = {Small satellites are growing in use for educational, scientific, and commercial purposes, usually in Low Earth Orbit(LEO) flights, given their lower costs and associated risks, as well as smaller lead times for assembling and testing. However, the typically short periods of LEO passes bring the need to find ways of optimizing the communication between the ground and space segments. In that direction, several projects have relied on ground station networks to increase the total time of contact with the satellites. In this type of arrangement, the stations agree in monitoring one or more satellites in such a way that, as the spacecraft exits one station's field of view, another station assumes its tracking, extending the total communication time and compensating the short passes. This type of solution, while very efficient in terms of costs, on the other hand demands a good synchronization procedure, so that all constraints present in its operations are taken into account and the network can operate effectively. This paper aims at describing a model implemented for orchestrating ground station networks that optimizes the communication capacity of the ground network, while taking into account physical constraints not usually considered in other models currently proposed.},

With this intention, we introduce two novel concepts: the cube transversals and the cube closures over the cube lattice of a categorical database relation. We propose a levelwise merging algorithm for mining minimal cube transversals with a single database scan. We introduce the cube connection, show that it is a Galois connection and derive a closure operator over the cube lattice. Using cube transversals and closures, we define a new characterization of boundary sets which provide a condensed representation of version spaces used to enhance supervised classification. The algorithm designed for computing such borders improves the complexity of previous proposals. We also introduce the concept of closed cube lattice and show that it is isomorph to on one hand the Galois lattice and on the other hand the quotient cube w.r.t. COUNT, SUM. Proposed in [16], the quotient cube is a succinct summary of a datacube preserving the Rollup/Drilldown semantics. We show that the quotient cube w.r.t. COUNT, SUM and the closed cube lattice have a similar expression power but the latter has the smallest possible size. Finally we focus on the multidimensional association issue and introduce the covering graph of the quotient cube which provides the user with a visualization tool of minimal multidimensional associations.},

The current work has been built upon the previous experience of the development of a similar tool for the planning of the observations of another ESA mission, the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL). Although tailored for specific XMM's requirements, XMAS is for this reason capable of dealing with modeling features, constraints and objectives common to both missions and may therefore be regarded as a more generic tool, covering many aspects of the scheduling problems for single-instrument space observatories. After a brief introduction on APSI study, the paper focuses on the peculiarities of XMM-Newton observations features and on the performance indexes, constraints and heuristics that have been necessary to deal with the given requirements. Results will then be presented according to two test sets, representative of typical XMM's LTP problems, and some conclusions and possible improvements will finally be outlined.},

  abstract = {The study of quantum generative models is well-motivated, not only because of its importance in quantum machine learning and quantum chemistry but also because of the perspective of its implementation on near-term quantum machines. Inspired by previous studies on the adversarial training of classical and quantum generative models, we propose the first design of quantum Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs), which has been shown to improve the robustness and the scalability of the adversarial training of quantum generative models even on noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, we propose a definition of the Wasserstein semimetric between quantum data, which inherits a few key theoretical merits of its classical counterpart. We also demonstrate how to turn the quantum Wasserstein semimetric into a concrete design of quantum WGANs that can be efficiently implemented on quantum machines. Our numerical study, via classical simulation of quantum systems, shows the more robust and scalable numerical performance of our quantum WGANs over other quantum GAN proposals. As a surprising application, our quantum WGAN has been used to generate a 3-qubit quantum circuit of \textasciitilde 50 gates that well approximates a 3-qubit 1-d Hamiltonian simulation circuit that requires over 10k gates using standard techniques.},

The cubicity of G, denoted as cub(G), is the minimum k such that G is the intersection graph of a collection of k-cubes. Many NP-complete graph problems can be solved efficiently or have good approximation ratios in graphs of low cubicity. In most of these cases the first step is to get a low dimensional cube representation of the given graph. It is known that for a graph G, cub(G){$\leqslant\lfloor$}2n3{$\rfloor$}. Recently it has been shown that for a graph G, cub(G){$\leqslant$}4({$\Delta$}+1)lnn, where n and {$\Delta$} are the number of vertices and maximum degree of G, respectively. In this paper, we show that for a bipartite graph G=(A{$\cup$}B,E) with |A|=n1, |B|=n2, n1{$\leqslant$}n2, and {$\Delta{'}$}=min\{{$\Delta$}A,{$\Delta$}B\}, where {$\Delta$}A=maxa{$\in$}Ad(a) and {$\Delta$}B=maxb{$\in$}Bd(b), d(a) and d(b) being the degree of a and b in G, respectively, cub(G){$\leqslant$}2({$\Delta{'}$}+2){$\lceil$}lnn2{$\rceil$}. We also give an efficient randomized algorithm to construct the cube representation of G in 3({$\Delta{'}$}+2){$\lceil$}lnn2{$\rceil$} dimensions. The reader may note that in general {$\Delta{'}$} can be much smaller than {$\Delta$}.},

The methods are: echo state network (a type of reservoir computing, RC-ESN), deep feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN), and recurrent neural network with long short-term memory (RNN-LSTM). This Lorenz system has three tiers of nonlinearly interacting variables representing slow/large-scale (\$X\$), intermediate (\$Y\$), and fast/small-scale (\$Z\$) processes. For training or testing, only \$X\$ is available; \$Y\$ and \$Z\$ are never known/used. It is shown that RC-ESN substantially outperforms ANN and RNN-LSTM for short-term prediction, e.g., accurately forecasting the chaotic trajectories for hundreds of numerical solver's time steps, equivalent to several Lyapunov timescales. RNN-LSTM and ANN show some prediction skills as well; RNN-LSTM bests ANN. Furthermore, even after losing the trajectory, data predicted by RC-ESN and RNN-LSTM have probability density functions (PDFs) that closely match the true PDF, even at the tails. PDF of the ANN data deviates from the true PDF. Implications, caveats, and applications to data-driven and inexact, data-assisted surrogate modeling of complex dynamical systems such as weather/climate are discussed.},

Many commercial products and services are now available, and all of the principal database management system vendors now have offerings in these areas. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed. This overview is based on a tutorial that the authors presented at the VLDB Conference, 1996.},

Finally, a numerical example is presented to verify the feasibility of proposed mission planning and the effectiveness of control law.},

  abstract = {Databases and data warehouse systems have been evolving from handling normalized spreadsheets stored in relational databases, to managing and analyzing diverse application-oriented data with complex interconnecting structures. Responding to this emerging trend, graphs have been growing rapidly and showing their critical importance in many applications, such as the analysis of XML, social networks, Web, biological data, multimedia data and spatiotemporal data. Can we extend useful functions of databases and data warehouse systems to handle graph structured data? In particular, OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) has been a popular tool for fast and user-friendly multi-dimensional analysis of data warehouses. Can we OLAP graphs? Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, there are no OLAP tools available that can interactively view and analyze graph data from different perspectives and with multiple granularities. In this paper, we argue that it is critically important to OLAP graph structured data and propose a novel Graph OLAP framework. According to this framework, given a graph dataset with its nodes and edges associated with respective attributes, a multi-dimensional model can be built to enable efficient on-line analytical processing so that any portions of the graphs can be generalized/specialized dynamically, offering multiple, versatile views of the data. The contributions of this work are three-fold. First, starting from basic definitions, i.e., what are dimensions and measures in the Graph OLAP scenario, we develop a conceptual framework for data cubes on graphs. We also look into different semantics of OLAP operations, and classify the framework into two major subcases: informational OLAP and topological OLAP. Second, we show how a graph cube can be materialized by calculating a special kind of measure called aggregated graph and how to implement it efficiently. This includes both full materialization and partial materialization where constraints are enforced to obtain an iceberg cube. As we can see, due to the increased structural complexity of data, aggregated graphs that depend on the underlying ``network'' properties of the graph dataset are much harder to compute than their traditional OLAP counterparts. Third, to provide more flexible, interesting and informative OLAP of graphs, we further propose a discovery-driven multi-dimensional analysis model to ensure that OLAP is performed in an intelligent manner, guided by expert rules and knowledge discovery processes. We outline such a framework and discuss some challenging research issues for discovery-driven Graph OLAP.},

The problem is then formulated as a mixed integer linear programming model, in which constraints are derived from a careful analysis of the interdependency between feasible time intervals that are eligible for observations.

As with other computationally hard combinatorial optimization problems, a two-stage heuristic method is developed to obtain high quality solutions in a reasonable amount of computation time. The first stage involves the determination of an observing sequence and the generation of a feasible scheduling scheme. We propose several priority-based and conflict-avoidance heuristic strategies and develop the time-based greedy approaches, the weight-based greedy approaches, and an improved differential evolution (DE) algorithm. The second stage consists of further improvement strategies under different resource contentions, thus improving the scheduling results further. Finally, we design different classes of instances to test the efficiency and applicability of the methods. Computational results reveal that the new proposed methods routinely delivered very close to optimal solutions.},

In such a scenario, the satellite can be divided into two categories, i.e., leader satellite with advanced sensors and follower satellite with general sensors. To make sure all leader satellite keep a desired relative configuration and fly with a constant velocity simultaneously, a cooperative formation control algorithm is proposed for each leader satellite. Then, to actuate all follower satellite converge into the convex hull spanned by the leader satellite for safety or navigation considerations, a distributed containment control algorithm is proposed for each follower satellite. One major contribution of the proposed algorithms lies in its collision-avoidance capacity among all satellite by equipping a close-range omnidirectional relative distance sensor and employing the potential functions methodology. Finally, simulation results are provided to verify the formation-containment performance as well as the collision-avoidance performance of the proposed control algorithms.},

We explain that there are four broad but easily identifiable systemic, pathologically networked conditions that are hurtling civilization toward potential self-destruction. As long as these conditions are not resolved, we should consider catastrophe as an inevitable emergent endpoint from the dynamics. All four conditions can be reversed with collective action to begin creating an enduring and thriving post- COVID-19 world. This will require maximal application of the precautionary principle.},

Our experiments show that our rules can effectively instantiate such systems (star schema and lattice). We also analyze differences between the two NoSQL systems considered. In our experiments, HBase (column-oriented) happens to be faster than MongoDB (document-oriented) in terms of loading time.},

  month = nov,
  abstract = {To make deliberate progress towards more intelligent and more human-like artificial systems, we need to be following an appropriate feedback signal: we need to be able to define and evaluate intelligence in a way that enables comparisons between two systems, as well as comparisons with humans. Over the past hundred years, there has been an abundance of attempts to define and measure intelligence, across both the fields of psychology and AI. We summarize and critically assess these definitions and evaluation approaches, while making apparent the two historical conceptions of intelligence that have implicitly guided them. We note that in practice, the contemporary AI community still gravitates towards benchmarking intelligence by comparing the skill exhibited by AIs and humans at specific tasks such as board games and video games. We argue that solely measuring skill at any given task falls short of measuring intelligence, because skill is heavily modulated by prior knowledge and experience: unlimited priors or unlimited training data allow experimenters to "buy" arbitrary levels of skills for a system, in a way that masks the system's own generalization power. We then articulate a new formal definition of intelligence based on Algorithmic Information Theory, describing intelligence as skill-acquisition efficiency and highlighting the concepts of scope, generalization difficulty, priors, and experience. Using this definition, we propose a set of guidelines for what a general AI benchmark should look like. Finally, we present a benchmark closely following these guidelines, the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), built upon an explicit set of priors designed to be as close as possible to innate human priors. We argue that ARC can be used to measure a human-like form of general fluid intelligence and that it enables fair general intelligence comparisons between AI systems and humans.},

When the Gateway is uncrewed, robotic science missions will be performed. The Gateway allows astronauts to practice the skills and test technologies needed for months and years beyond Low Earth Orbit. A key to success for these deep space missions will be carefully coordinated operations by ground support, flight crew, and autonomous spacecraft.},

  abstract = {With the aim of supporting satellite Terabit connectivity, the future generations of High Throughput Systems - HTS rely on the exploitation of Q/V band frequencies. These frequency bands offer the possibility to have larger bandwidth availability with respect to Ka-band systems, freeing the portion of the Ka frequency band that is currently allocated to feeder links and offering bigger portion of spectrum for specific services, such as the aeronautical in-flight entertainment and connectivity (IFEC) services. The design of a Ground Segment for Q/V band satellite communications presents however several technological challenges. The design of antennas, power amplifiers with high efficiency and Low Noise receivers are critical, nevertheless they are fundamental to support high data rate transmissions. Furthermore, to counteract atmospheric impairments, a system able to implement and manage a handover mechanism between gateways is also needed. A Ground Segment for Q/V band high throughput system has been conceived in the project ``Q/V band earth segment LInk for Future high Throughput space systems'' (QV-LIFT), funded by the European Commission in the framework of the Horizon 2020 program. The consolidation of crucial technologies for new generation satellite communications is addressed, with the objective to ensure space accessibility to Europe and, in particular, to foster technology readiness of European industries in space related sectors. This paper provides the description of key hardware and software developments for next generation HTS systems operating in Q/V band, based on core technologies for both ground and user segments currently under development for the QV-LIFT project. The system test architecture which will be used to validate the developed technology and functionalities is also presented, together with the overview of the project status and validation plan.},

These algorithms seek to provide accurate results while minimizing the required storage and the processing time, at the price of a small inaccuracy in their output. A fundamental query of interest is the intersection size of two big data streams. This problem arises in many different application areas, such as network monitoring, database systems, data integration and information retrieval. In this paper we develop a new algorithm for this problem, based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method. We show that this algorithm outperforms all known schemes and that it asymptotically achieves the optimal variance.},

While currently available quantum computers have less than 100 qubits, quantum computer hardware is widely expected to grow in terms of qubit counts, quality, and connectivity. Our article aims to explain the principles of quantum programming, which are quite different from classical programming, with straight-forward algebra that makes understanding the underlying quantum mechanics optional (but still fascinating). We give an introduction to quantum computing algorithms and their implementation on real quantum hardware. We survey 20 different quantum algorithms, attempting to describe each in a succintc and self-contained fashion; we show how they are implemented on IBM's quantum computer; and in each case we discuss the results of the implementation with respect to differences of the simulator and the actual hardware runs. This article introduces computer scientists and engineers to quantum algorithms and provides a blueprint for their implementations.},

As of October 2011, the Kepler spacecraft has collected and returned to Earth just over 290 GB of data, identifying 1235 planet candidates with 25 of these candidates confirmed as planets via ground observation. Extracting the telltale signature of a planetary system from stellar photometry where valid signal transients can be as small as a 40 ppm is a difficult and exacting task. The end-to-end process of determining planetary candidates from noisy, raw photometric measurements is discussed. The Kepler mission is described in overview and the Kepler technique for discovering exoplanets is discussed. The design and implementation of the Kepler spacecraft, tracing the data path from photons entering the telescope aperture through raw observation data transmitted to the ground operations team is described. The technical challenges of operating a large aperture photometer with an unprecedented 95 million pixel detector are addressed as well as the onboard technique for processing and reducing the large volume of data produced by the Kepler photometer. The technique and challenge of day-to-day mission operations that result in a very high percentage of time on target is discussed. This includes the day to day process for monitoring and managing the health of the spacecraft, the annual process for maintaining sun on the solar arrays while still keeping the telescope pointed at the fixed science target, the process for safely but rapidly returning to science operations after a spacecraft initiated safing event and the long term anomaly resolution process. The ground data processing pipeline, from the point that science data is received on the ground to the presentation of preliminary planetary candidates and supporting data to the science team for further evaluation is discussed. Ground management, control, exchange and storage of Kepler's large and growing data set is discussed as well as the process and techniques for removing noise sources and applying calibrations to intermediate data products.},

One of the new test facilities that will be part of the LIT is an integrated CPTR and NFS facility for antenna and satellite payload testing. The systems engineering approach includes systems engineering processes, such as stakeholder needs and requirements definition, system concepts definition, system requirements definition, system analysis, and architecture definition. The approach also describes specific methods and tools that were implemented within each process, such as stakeholder interviews, life cycle analysis, context diagrams, and behavioral diagrams. Additionally, this paper presents a review of several existing compact test range and near-field facilities whose characteristics aided in the elaboration of the specifications.

  abstract = {Satellites transmit data streams to the ground that consist of data values, called mnemonics, that are used to determine the health and location of the satellite. These data streams can contain between 700 and 12000 or more mnemonics. These mnemonics must be analyzed to ensure that the satellite is healthy, to assist in resolving any anomalies, and to determine if there are any trends that would indicate a possible future problem. Satellite engineers need assistance to assimilate and act on these large volumes of data. The USAF Phillips Laboratory Space System Technologies Division (PL/VTS) has developed a telemetry analysis system called the Visual Interface for Satellite Telemetry Analysis (VISTA) that captures and displays satellite telemetry data in real time and provides tools for analyzing stored data. An important aspect of VISTA is the analysis of stored telemetry data. The satellite engineer needs quick, accurate access to the stored satellite data in numerous forms, such as plots, reports; curve fitting, and Fourier analysis graphs. The challenge was to develop a telemetry analysis system that was flexible, fast, accurate, and able to provide the multiple views of the data required by the satellite engineers. This paper provides an overview of VISTA, and then discusses how the telemetry analysis tool (TAT) was developed, how the system functions, timing information, and future work},

This novel distance is a relevant contribution over the simpler low-level-field-based distance presented in [1]. Second, we provide a comprehensive experimental campaign of ClustCube algorithms for computing ClustCube cubes, according to both performance metrics and accuracy metrics, against a well-known benchmark data set, and in comparison with a state-of-the-art subspace clustering algorithm for high-dimensional data. Retrieved results clearly demonstrate the superiority of our approach.},

  abstract = {A novel top-down compression technique for data cubes is introduced and experimentally assessed in this paper. This technique considers the previously unrecognized case in which multiple Hierarchical Range Queries (HRQ), a very useful class of OLAP queries, must be evaluated against the target data cube simultaneously. This scenario makes traditional data cube compression techniques ineffective, as, contrary to the aim of our work, these techniques take into consideration one constraint only (e.g., a given storage space bound). The result of our study consists in introducing an innovative multiple-objective OLAP computational paradigm, and a hierarchical multidimensional histogram, whose main benefit is meaningfully implementing an intermediate compression of the input data cube able to simultaneously accommodate an even large family of different-in-nature HRQ. A complementary contribution of our work is represented by a wide experimental evaluation of the performance of our technique against both benchmark and real-life data cubes, also in comparison with state-of-the-art histogram-based compression techniques.},

  abstract = {At present, most small satellites are delivered as hosted payloads on large launch vehicles. Considering the current technological development, constellations of small satellites can provide a broad range of services operating at designated orbits. To achieve that, small satellite customers are seeking cost-effective launch services for dedicated missions. This paper deals with performance and cost assessments of a set of launch vehicle concepts based on a solid propellant rocket engine (S-50) under development by the Institute of Aeronautics and Space (Brazil) with support from the Brazilian Space Agency. Cost estimation analysis, based on the TRANSCOST model, was carried out taking into account the costs of launch system development, vehicle fabrication, direct and indirect operation cost. A cost-competitive expendable launch system was identified by using three S-50 solid rocket motors for the first stage, one S-50 engine for the second stage and a flight-proven cluster of pressure-fed liquid engines for the third stage. This launch system, operating from the Alcantara Launch Center, located at 2     {$\circ$}    20\&rsquo; S, would deliver satellites from the 500 kg class in typical polar missions with a specific transportation cost of about US\$39,000 per kilogram of payload at a rate of 12 launches per year, in dedicated missions. At a low inclined orbit, vehicle payload capacity increased, decreasing the specific transportation cost to about 32,000 US\$/kg. Cost analysis also showed that vehicle development effort would claim 781 work year, or less than 80 million dollars. Vehicle fabrication accounted for 174 work year representing less than 23 million dollars per unit. The launch system based on the best concept would, therefore, deploy small satellite constellations in cost-effective dedicated launches, 224 work year per flight, from the Alcantara Launch Center in Brazil.},

In this area, private set intersection (PSI) and its variants play an important role when the participants wish to do secret operations on their input sets. Unlike the most modern public key cryptosystems relying on number theoretic problems, lattice-based cryptographic constructions provide security in the presence of a quantum computer. Consequently, developing PSI and its variants using lattice based cryptosystem becomes an interesting direction for research. This study presents the first size-hiding post quantum PSI cardinality (PSI-CA) protocol whose complexity is linear in the size of the sets of the participants. The authors use space-efficient probabilistic data structure (Bloom filter) as its building block. Further, they extend the authors' PSI-CA to its authorised version, i.e. authorised PSI-CA. Security for both of them is achieved in the standard model based on the hardness of the decisional learning with errors problem.},

  abstract = {In the Big Data warehouse context, a column-oriented NoSQL database system is considered as the storage model which is highly adapted to data warehouses and online analysis. Indeed, the use of NoSQL models allows data scalability easily and the columnar store is suitable for storing and managing massive data, especially for decisional queries. However, the column-oriented NoSQL DBMS do not offer online analysis operators (OLAP). To build OLAP cubes corresponding to the analysis contexts, the most common way is to integrate other software such as HIVE or Kylin which has a CUBE operator to build data cubes. By using that, the cube is built according to the roworiented approach and does not allow to fully obtain the benefits of a column-oriented approach. In this article, the focus is to define a cube operator called MC-CUBE (MapReduce Columnar CUBE), which allows building columnar NoSQL cubes according to the columnar approach by taking into account the non-relational and distributed aspects when data warehouses are stored.

The huge amount of data which will be archived in the upcoming solar observatories press us to compress the data in order to reduce the storage space and transfer times. The correlation present over all dimensions, spatial, temporal and spectral, of solar data-sets suggests the use of a 3D base wavelet decomposition, to achieve higher compression rates. In this work, we evaluate the performance of the recent JPEG2000 Part 10 standard, known as JP3D, for the lossless compression of several types of solar data-cubes. We explore the differences in: a) The compressibility of broad-band or narrow-band time-sequence; I or V Stokes profiles in spectropolarimetric data-sets; b) Compressing data in [x,y, {$\lambda$}] packages at different times or data in [x,y,t] packages of different wavelength; c) Compressing a single large data-cube or several smaller data-cubes; d) Compressing data which is under-sampled or super-sampled with respect to the diffraction cut-off.},

We first show a lower bound on the size of the memory necessary to approximate queries and then consider a statistical hypothesis where some attributes determine fixed distributions of the measure. We use the sampling methods to learn the statistical model and approximate OLAP queries. In this case, we approximate OLAP queries with a finite memory. We apply the method to a dataset which simulates the data of sensors, which provide weather parameters over time and locations from different sources.},

Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle:  `every finitely realizable physical system can be perfectly simulated by a  universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics  and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter  discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of  model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing  machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the `universal  quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling  the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would  have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These  do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include  `quantum parallelism', a me...},

The CYGNSS flight segment consists of 8 microsatellite-class observatories, which represent SwRI's first spacecraft bus design, installed on a Deployment Module for launch. The microsatellites (microsats) are identical in design but provide their own individual contribution to the CYGNSS science data set. Within the first year of the CYGNSS program (Phase A and B), the design has been analyzed, vetted, and reviewed which culminated in a succession of updates and design improvements. This paper will discuss relevant updates to the electrical systems of the microsat, specifically the command and data subsystem (CDS) and the electrical power subsystem (EPS). For the CDS, more detailed analysis of the communication link and maturation of the transceiver module design are presented. The link budget was reviewed by the team and verified via simulation. The transceiver module has moved to a dedicated box consisting of a radio frequency (RF) board and a digital signal processing (DSP) board. For the EPS, a detailed power analysis of the mission has led to an update in the solar array configuration. The details of the power analysis, which is performed in STK and Matlab, are presented.},

  abstract = {Set intersection is a fundamental operation in information retrieval and database systems. This paper introduces linear space data structures to represent sets such that their intersection can be computed in a worst-case efficient way. In general, given k (preprocessed) sets, with totally n elements, we will show how to compute their intersection in expected time O(n/sqrt(w)+kr), where r is the intersection size and w is the number of bits in a machine-word. In addition,we introduce a very simple version of this algorithm that has weaker asymptotic guarantees but performs even better in practice; both algorithms outperform the state of the art techniques in terms of execution time for both synthetic and real data sets and workloads.},

The Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has developed an innovative Mission Operations Center (MOC) designed to accommodate the constellation's significant planning and data downlink requirements [2]. The large number of data downlink opportunities necessitates a MOC that can easily identify and schedule ground contacts, and autonomously run the ground contact events from initiation of acquisition to delivery of the L0 science data. This paper will discuss the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and Government off-the-shelf (GOTS) tools leveraged, as well as in-house developed software that allow the CYGNSS MOC to meet the constellation operational challenge in a cost effective manner.},

While such a concept of focused interaction is relevant to many domains besides OLAP explorations, like web search or interactive database exploration, there is currently no precise formal, commonly agreed definition. This concept of focus phase is drawn from Exploratory Search, which is a paradigm that theorized search as a complex interaction between a user and a system. The interaction consists of two different phases: an exploratory phase where the user is progressively defining her information need, and a focused phase where she investigates in details precise facts, and learn from this investigation. Following this model, our work is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to propose a formal feature-based description of a focused query in the context of interactive data exploration. Our experiments show that we manage to identify focused queries in real navigations, and that our model is sufficiently robust and general to be applied to different OLAP navigations datasets.},

As we analyze the progress of PI we try to situate Floridi's program in the context of scientific and technological development that have been made last ten years. We emphasize that Philosophy of Information is a huge and vibrant research field, with its origins dating before Open Problems, and its domains extending even outside their scope. In this paper, we have been able only to sketch some of the developments during the past ten years. Our hope is that, even if fragmentary, this review may serve as a contribution to the effort of understanding the present state of the art and the paths of development of Philosophy of Information as seen through the lens of Open Problems.},

Brown Dwarf distributes a centralized indexing structure among peers on-the-fly, reducing cube creation and querying times by enforcing parallelization. Analytical queries are naturally performed on-line through cooperating nodes that form an unstructured Peer-to-Peer overlay. Updates are also performed on-line, eliminating the usually costly over-night process. Moreover, the system employs an adaptive replication scheme that adjusts to the workload skew as well as the network churn by expanding or shrinking the units of the distributed data structure. Our system has been thoroughly evaluated on an actual testbed: it manages to accelerate cube creation up and querying up to several tens of times compared to the centralized solution by exploiting the capabilities of the available network nodes working in parallel. It also manages to quickly adapt even after sudden bursts in load and remains unaffected with a considerable fraction of frequent node failures. These advantages are even more apparent for dense and skewed data cubes and workloads.},

Efficient roll-up and drill-down operations take place in order to maximize the performance by minimizing query flooding. Updates are performed on-line, with minimal communication overhead, depending on the level of consistency needed. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that, on top of the advantages that a distributed storage offers, our method answers the vast majority of incoming queries, both point and aggregate ones, without flooding the network and without causing significant storage or load imbalance. Our scheme proves to be especially efficient in cases of skewed workloads, even when these change dynamically with time. At the same time, it manages to preserve the hierarchical nature of data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards the support of concept hierarchies in DHTs.},

However, the existing methods cannot be well applied, because the telemetry data is large and high-dimensional. In this paper, an efficient algorithm named QARC Apriori is proposed. First, to reduce the redundant attributes and lower the problem complexity, grey relational analysis method is applied. Second, each filtered attribute is partitioned into several subintervals, combining with K-Means clustering algorithm. During clustering, the outliers are removed to improve the accuracy of clustering results. Due to different distributions and scopes of attributes, the clustering centers are automatically adjusted. Moreover, the statistical information of each attribute is used to avoid repeatedly scanning database. Finally, all quantitative association rules are mined by an improved Apriori algorithm. In order to improve the mining efficiency, two pruning strategies are used. The experiments are conducted with the power supply data of a China's satellite from 2011.6.1 to 2011.9.1. It indicates that the proposed algorithm is suitable for quantitative association rules mining and is important for satellite on-orbit performance analysis.},

Two popular efforts devoted to this problem are (1) iceberg cube, where only significant cells are kept, and (2) closed cube, where a group of cells which preserve roll-up/drill-down semantics are losslessly compressed to one cell. Due to its usability and importance, efficient computation of closed cubes still warrants a thorough study. In this paper, we propose a new measure, called closedness, for efficient closed data cubing. We show that closedness is an algebraic measure and can be computed efficiently and incrementally. Based on closedness measure, we develop an an aggregation-based approach, called C-Cubing (i.e., Closed-Cubing), and integrate it into two successful iceberg cubing algorithms: MM-Cubing and Star-Cubing. Our performance study shows that C-Cubing runs almost one order of magnitude faster than the previous approaches. We further study how the performance of the alternative algorithms of C-Cubing varies w.r.t the properties of the data sets.},

  abstract = {In this paper, various approaches to the successful implementation of concurrent engineering are presented. Approach 1 addresses the information and software requirements of an integrated manufacturing information system. Two sets of data requirements for the design of mechanical products are discussed. Approach 2 uses feature based design as the impetus behind CAD/CAM integration. A conceptual framework leading to the development of a knowledge-based management system (KBMS) is proposed. KBMS is capable of representing multiple and concurrent views of features. Approach 3 considers product design concerns from inception to disposal in a unified life cycle engineering (ULCE) environment. Approach 4 focuses on assembly as an integrative function of all manufacturing activities. Approach 5 emphasises organisational and cultural issues and proposes that effective dialogue between design and manufacturing engineers is essential for abandoning the ``over-the-wall design'' concept. In conclusion, a critique of various approaches to concurrent engineering is provided.},

These DRE systems must not only operate over a range of temporal and spatial scales, but also require stringent assurances for secure interactions between the system's tasks without violating their individual timing constraints. To address these challenges, this paper describes a novel distributed operating system focusing on the scheduler design to support the mixed criticality task sets.

During the separation event, and subsequently during Schiaparelli's Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL), the NASA-provided Electra Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) payload onboard TGO was used to record signals from the Schiaparelli Lander for post-processing on the ground to recover both tracking of the lander's carrier signal and reconstruction of the lander's 8 kb/s telemetry. In addition, ESA's Mars Express orbiter recorded the Schiaparelli signal, with ground post-processing providing independent tracking of the lander carrier signal, and the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope near Pune, India was configured to provide real-time detection of the lander carrier signal. While an anomaly in the latter stages of EDL led to loss of the lander, these critical event data sets, and in particular the telemetry reconstruction enabled by the TGO Electra recording, proved essential in enabling detailed diagnosis of the anomaly. While the loss of the lander during EDL precluded the planned surface relay operations, the preparations for that activity provide important lessons learned for future Mars relay support scenarios.},

This paper presents a method for automatically inducing new production rules from existing sample designs. The methods applicability is illustrated in context of conceptual spacecraft design.

  abstract = {Monitoring the health and well-being of human beings during any manned spaceflight is a critical aspect of the space mission. To date this has been done almost exclusively with telemetry to ground stations and monitoring of the physiological data by physicians. With lunar and Mars missions the transmission latency become problematic, and in additional to longer latency, Mars missions would also be subject to more restricted bandwidth availability and to blackout periods due to the normal rotation of Mars when the lander would be on the far side of the planet relative to earth for roughly half of each Mars solar day. While these blackout period could be reduced or removed with relay satellite in Martian orbit, this may not be practical for early missions to Mars. As such, Autonomous Medical Care has been identified by NASA as one of the top priority technologies to be developed for Mars missions, with seven Risk Categories with that area. Two of these are Monitoring and Prevention; and Medical Informatics, Technologies and Support Systems. In this paper, the Artemis platform, which was developed originally for real-time diagnostics in neonatal intensive care is presented as a solution to these areas of Autonomous Medical Care for Mars missions. This platform has the capability, in addition to real-time diagnostics, to provide supervisory medical monitoring, modularity in deployment of specialized diagnostic algorithms and also the offline (earth-based) development and deployment of new algorithms based on additional mission needs. The platform and these capabilities are described, along with examples of its use. Furthermore, its requirements in terms of resources within the inherently limited resources of a long space mission are also presented and analysed, and a proposed physical architecture for both the space and ground control components are proposed.},

  title = {Efficient {{Analytical Queries}} on {{Semantic Web Data Cubes}}},
  author = {Etcheverry, Lorena and Vaisman, Alejandro A.},
  year = {2017},
  month = mar,
  abstract = {The amount of multidimensional data published on the semantic web (SW) is constantly increasing, due to initiatives such as Open Data and Open Government Data, among other ones. Models, languages, and tools, that allow to obtain valuable information efficiently, are thus required. Multidimensional data are typically represented as data cubes, and exploited using Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) techniques. The RDF Data Cube Vocabulary, also denoted QB, is the current W3C standard to represent statistical data on the SW.Since QB does not include key features needed for OLAP analysis, in previous work we have proposed an extension, denoted QB4OLAP, to overcome this problem without the need of modifying already published data. Once data cubes are represented on the SW, we need tools to analyze them. However, writing efficient analytical queries over SW cubes demands a deep knowledge of RDF and SPARQL. These skills are not common in typical analytical users. Also, OLAP languages like MDX are far from being easily understood by the final user. The lack of friendly tools to exploit multidimensional data on the SW is a barrier that needs to be broken to promote the publication of such data. We address this problem in this paper. Our approach is based on allowing analytical users to write queries using OLAP operations over cubes, without dealing with SW standards. For this, we devised CQL (standing for Cube Query Language), a simple, high-level query language that operates over cubes. Using the metadata provided by QB4OLAP, we translate CQL queries into SPARQL. Then, we propose query improvement strategies to produce efficient SPARQL queries, adapting SPARQL query optimization techniques. We evaluate our approach using the Star-Schema benchmark, showing that our proposal outperforms others. A web application that allows querying SW data cubes using CQL, completes our contributions.},

External data (particularly web data), may be useful to enhance local analysis. In this paper we discuss the extraction of multidimensional data from web sources, and their representation in RDFS. We introduce Open Cubes, an RDFS vocabulary for the specification and publication of multidimensional cubes on the Semantic Web, and show how classical OLAP operations can be implemented over Open Cubes using SPARQL 1.1, without the need of mapping the multidimensional information to the local database (the usual approach to multidimensional analysis of Semantic Web data). We show that our approach is plausible for the data sizes that can usually be retrieved to enhance local data repositories.},

  abstract = {The web is changing the way in which data warehouses are designed, used, and queried. With the advent of initiatives such as Open Data and Open Government, organizations want to share their multidimensional data cubes and make them available to be queried online. The RDF data cube vocabulary (QB), the W3C standard to publish statistical data in RDF, presents several limitations to fully support the multidimensional model. The QB4OLAP vocabulary extends QB to overcome these limitations, allowing to im- plement the typical OLAP operations, such as rollup, slice, dice, and drill-across using standard SPARQL queries. In this paper we introduce a formal data model where the main object is the data cube, and define OLAP operations using this model, independent of the underlying representation of the cube. We show then that a cube expressed using our model can be represented using the QB4OLAP vocabulary, and finally we provide a SPARQL implementation of OLAP operations over data cubes in QB4OLAP.},

In particular, the control produces the detumbling of the satellite and leads it to a desired attitude with respect to the direction of the Earth magnetic field, based on the only information provided by a three-axis magnetometer. The system is meant to be used as a backup solution, in case of failure of the primary strategy and is designed considering the constraints set on time of operations, power consumption, and peak electric current for a typical CubeSat mission. The detumbling and pointing algorithms are implemented on the FPGA core of a CubeSat on-board computer and tested by Hardware-in-the-loop simulations. The simulation setup includes a Helmholtz cage, recreating the magnetic environment along the orbit, the on-board computer, a MEMS three-axis magnetometer and Simulink software, on which the attitude dynamics is propagated. Test on the real system can provide useful information to select the parameters of the control, such as the gains, to estimate the limits of the system, the time of operations and prevent failures.},

  abstract = {Data mining is a difficult task that relies on an exploratory and analytic process of large quantities of data in order to discover meaningful patterns and rules. It requires complex methodologies, and the increasing heterogeneity and complexity of available data requires some skills to build the data mining processes, or knowledge flows. The goal of this work is to describe data-mining processes in terms of Automated Planning, which will allow us to automatize the data-mining knowledge flow construction. The work is based on the use of standards both in data mining and automated-planning communities. We use PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) to describe data mining tasks. From the PMML, a problem description in PDDL can be generated, so any current planning system can be used to generate a plan. This plan is, again, translated to a KFML format (Knowledge Flow file for the WEKA tool), so the plan or data-mining workflow can be executed in WEKA. In this manuscript we describe the languages, how the translation from PMML to PDDL, and from a plan to KFML are performed, and the complete architecture of our system.},

Having a standard format for describing the telemetry and command formats allows for the development or adoption of compatible tools and significantly reduces the amount of custom software development often needed to ensure all system components have access to consistent format definitions. The main objective of this paper is to show how powerful XTCE is in terms of interoperability across organizations. This paper summarizes work which entailed converting the mission telemetry database for a current NASA mission, in XTCE format, into several target mission operation databases associated with different telemetry and command toolchains, and then, comparing the results of the telemetry processing and display. The target toolchains selected were Ball Aerospace/COSMOS, NASA-GSFC/ITOS (Goddard Space Flight Center/Integrated Test and Operations System), and NASA-AMMOS/AMPCS (Advanced Multi-Mission Operations System/Mission Data Processing and Control System) - all real-time telemetry and command processing systems.},

  abstract = {ASTERIA (Arcsecond Space Telescope Enabling Research In Astrophysics) is a CubeSat space telescope currently operating in low-Earth orbit. It is expected to remain in orbit at least through October 2019. Developed as a technology demonstration mission under the Jet Propulsion Laboratory Phaeton Program for training early-career engineers, ASTERIA has achieved sub-arcsecond pointing stability and milliKelvin thermal stability over 20-minute observations. These capabilities-unprecedented in a CubeSat platform-have enabled photometric precision better than 1000 parts per million per minute (0.1\%/min) while observing nearby bright stars (apparent visual magnitude magv {$<$} 6). Following the second extended mission, we are now using the spacecraft in its third extension as a platform to demonstrate additional capabilities as well as continue science observations. This project will perform the following four well-focused activities that will raise the technology readiness of key spacecraft technologies. 1. Shift the paradigm to operate spacecraft from open-loop commanding to closed-loop command execution: We will introduce ``task networks'' (tasknets)which allow simpler commanding and more robust onboard execution. 2. Demonstrate onboard orbit determination in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) using autonomous navigation (Autonav)without the Global Positioning System (GPS): This activity will demonstrate a fully independent means of spacecraft orbit determination for Earth orbiters using only passive imaging. 3. Collect data on ASTERIA that will feed into future missions by characterizing the spacecraft pointing jitter as a function of target brightness, reaction wheel speed, controller gain, and number of guide stars. 4. Perform ASTERIA extended mission science: ASTERIA has demonstrated unprecedented photometric precision for a CubeSat mission. The spacecraft is uniquely suited to perform long-term monitoring of stars such as alpha Centauri for small transiting planets. The discovery of a transiting Earth-sized planet around alpha Cen A and/or B would be of the highest scientific value as such a planet would be our closest exoplanetary neighbor orbiting a Sunlike star. These demonstrations will provide in-flight testing of new autonomy technologies, maximize the scientific potential of this operational spacecraft, and provide additional characterization of hardware for future small satellite missions using similar subsystems.},

  abstract = {Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. Beyond a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, hierarchical reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks and decentralized optimization can all be seen as instances of this setting. However, the presence of multiple learning agents in these settings renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method that reasons about the anticipated learning of the other agents. The LOLA learning rule includes an additional term that accounts for the impact of the agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. We show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the likelihood ratio policy gradient update, making the method suitable for model-free RL. This method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. Preliminary results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma (IPD), while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to infinitely repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents can successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using deep recurrent policies. Again, by considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of selfish interests.},

The controller places satellites into a constellation with specified angular offsets and zero-relative speed. Time optimal phasing is achieved by first determining an appropriate relative placement, i.e. the order of the satellites. A second optimization problem is then solved as a large coupled system to find the drag command profile required for each satellite. The control authority is the available ratio of low-drag to high-drag ballistic coefficients of the satellites when operating in their background mode. The controller is able to successfully phase constellations with up to 100 satellites in simulations. On-orbit performance of the controller is demonstrated by phasing the Planet Flock 2p constellation of twelve cubesats launched in June 2016 into a 510 km sun-synchronous orbit.},

The synergy of analytical frameworks and augmented reality opens the door to a new wave of situated OLAP, in which users within a physical environment are provided with immersive analyses of local contextual data. In this paper we propose an approach that, based on the sensed augmented context (provided by wearable and smart devices), proposes a set of relevant analytical queries to the user. This is done by relying on a mapping between the entities that can be recognized by the devices and the elements of the enterprise data, and also taking into account the queries preferred by users during previous interactions that occurred in similar contexts. A set of experimental tests evaluates the proposed approach in terms of efficiency and effectiveness.},

  abstract = {The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System constellation of eight micro-satellites in low-Earth orbit was designed to provide continuous, gap-free coverage for hurricane forecasting and monitoring throughout the life-cycle of a tropical storm. To provide the capability, the spacecraft Attitude Determination and Control System must accurately and reliably slew and hold its attitude - and by extension, its payload data collection antennae - to prescribed knowledge and pointing requirements. The CYGNSS constellation launched in December 2016 and has been collecting and serving data since the start of the tropical storm period in 2017. This paper presents the flight performance of the ADCS system in key ADCS modes and compares its on-orbit performance to its design and simulation predicted responses. Flight telemetry analysis uncovered an anomaly in one of the ADCS modes that interfered with the spacecraft's observatory mode and induced a sustained, once-per-orbit pitch oscillation in all eight spacecraft. This anomaly was conjectured to trace to a spurious magnetic dipole induced on the spacecraft due to some electrical effects in the main power circuitry. This root-cause analysis is summarised in this paper as is the retuning that was undertaken on the estimation and control system parameters to improve disturbance prediction and rejection within the existing ADCS architecture. Data is presented from spacecraft simulations as well as flight, before and after the redesign, that shows the efficacy of the redesigned ADCS system to reject the spurious, anomalous disturbance and recover the required performance.},

The suspicion is expressed that no end will be in sight until a means is found to reduce quantum theory to two or three statements of crisp physical (rather than abstract, axiomatic) significance. In this regard, no tool appears better calibrated for a direct assault than quantum information theory. Far from a strained application of the latest fad to a time-honored problem, this method holds promise precisely because a large part--but not all--of the structure of quantum theory has always concerned information. It is just that the physics community needs reminding. This paper, though taking quant-ph/0106166 as its core, corrects one mistake and offers several observations beyond the previous version. In particular, I identify one element of quantum mechanics that I would not label a subjective term in the theory--it is the integer parameter D traditionally ascribed to a quantum system via its Hilbert-space dimension.},

The traditional approach for satellite health monitoring is to check sensor values whether being within permissible ranges or not. This paper proposes a supervised Na\"ive Bayesian classifier to build data driven models that detect power supply system anomaly. Battery flight test data has been used as the abnormal class, representing possible failures, an approach to overcome the problem of unavailability of labeled abnormal data in a supervised classification. Data used to build the model is a three months observation of battery's capacitance, voltage, temperature and pressure. Data has been subjected to principal component analysis before Na\"ive Bayesian classifier model building for visualization, labeling training data and to increase the variables independence as a restriction imposed by the na\"ive Bayesian classifier. The built Na\"ive Bayesian classifier model is validated using real faulty data in terms of accuracy, recall, precision, Fl-score and ROC curve.},

In this paper we propose an original approach to OLAP on collections stored in document-oriented databases. The basic idea is to stop fighting against schema variety and welcome it as an inherent source of information wealth in schemaless sources. Our approach builds on four stages: schema extraction, schema integration, FD enrichment, and querying; these stages are discussed in detail in the paper. To make users aware of the impact of schema variety, we propose a set of indicators related for instance to query completeness and precision.},

  abstract = {The ARIEL mission main goal is the measurement of atmospheres of transiting planets. This requires the observation of two types of events: primary and secondary eclipses. In order to yield measurements of sufficient Signal-to-Noise Ratio to fulfill the mission objectives, the events of each exoplanet have to be observed several times. In addition, several criteria have to be considered to carry out each observation, such as the exoplanet visibility, its event duration, its potential significance in the survey, and no overlapping with other tasks. Consequently, obtaining a long term mission plan becomes unaffordable for human planners due to the complexity of computing the huge number of possible combinations for finding an optimum solution. In this contribution we present a mission planning tool based on Evolutionary Algorithms, which are focused on solving optimization problems such as the planning of several tasks. Specifically, the proposed tool finds a solution that highly optimizes the defined objectives, which are based on the maximization of the time spent on scientific observations and the scientific return. The results obtained on the large experimental set up support that the proposed scheduler technology is robust and can function in a variety of scenarios, offering a competitive performance which does not depend on the collection of exoplanets to be observed.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the results of a study to find possible Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) capable of being captured using upcoming rocketry for the purposes of space-based mining, combining reusable rockets such as SpaceX's Big Falcon Rocket (i.e. BFR) and refueling capabilities. This work introduces a relatively low-cost option with higher Delta V, \$\textbackslash triangle V\$, compared to non-reusable rockets, and an opportunity for NASA's Lunar Orbital Platform-Gateway (LOP-G) for synergy with services, science, and technologies. In an effort to maximize the number of viable missions, the study focused on choosing a refueling orbit near LOP-G; thus, the Earth-Moon Lagrange points L1 and L2 were selected as possible choices for this paper. The resulting simulations of a Cislunar infrastructure orbiting in Lagrange points highlight differences in orbital options. Indeed, the optimal option is balanced between a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) in L1 and a NRHO in L2. The decision for optimal positioning of any Gateway Station is dependent on the type of mission allocated to the Cislunar station. However, both options seem promising, not only for asteroid extraction and mining but also for crewed and cargo missions. In a worst case scenario, an operation of 3 decades starting in 2030 retrieving 33 asteroids, or 1.1 per year, comprising up to 2,581 tons in minerals. The work culminated in developing a data mining online tool that searches the entire Near Earth Asteroids (NEA) close approach database from JPL and the small body database from NASA. Using a fleet of 10 BFRs over 30 years may provide a higher long-term success for a business case than any other investment on Earth.},

This application is part of a satellite ground station that processes sensor data from payloads and monitors the SOH of the ground station itself. The first payload of the constellation was launched in 2001. The PSOH application was used successfully for Early Orbit Turn-on (EOT) testing, and it is currently processing data autonomously. The PSOH application was developed with three types of users in mind. It accommodates the needs of payload designers who predominately use it during EOT. It uses a highly intuitive graphical Human Computer Interface (HCI) that allows a non-expert ground station operator to monitor all payloads of the constellation with a minimal chance of human error. It generates messages that provide a persistent record of any anomalies for use by the sensor data analyst. This paper shows how early development of the ground station PSOH application can benefit the three main users the sensor designer, the operator, and the data analyst.},

  abstract = {Here, we introduce a new class of computer which does not use any circuit or logic gate. In fact, no program needs to be written: it learns by itself and writes its own program to solve a problem. G\"odel's incompleteness argument is explored here to devise an engine where an astronomically large number of ``if-then'' arguments are allowed to grow by self-assembly, based on the basic set of arguments written in the system, thus, we explore the beyond Turing path of computing but following a fundamentally different route adopted in the last half-a-century old non-Turing adventures. Our hardware is a multilayered seed structure. If we open the largest seed, which is the final hardware, we find several computing seed structures inside, if we take any of them and open, there are several computing seeds inside. We design and synthesize the smallest seed, the entire multilayered architecture grows by itself. The electromagnetic resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit). The computer solves intractable pattern search (Clique) problem without searching, since the right pattern written in it spontaneously replies back to the questioner. To learn, the hardware filters any kind of sensory input image into several layers of images, each containing basic geometric polygons (fractal decomposition), and builds a network among all layers, multi-sensory images are connected in all possible ways to generate ``if'' and ``then'' argument. Several such arguments and decisions (phase transition from ``if'' to ``then'') self-assemble and form the two giant columns of arguments and rules of phase transition. Any input question is converted into a pattern as noted above, and these two astronomically large columns project a solution. The driving principle of computing is synchronization and de-synchronization of network paths, the system drives towards highest density of coupled arguments for maximum matching. Memory is located at all layers of the hardware. Learning, computing occurs everywhere simultaneously. Since resonance chain connects all computing seeds, wireless processing is feasible without a screening effect. The computing power is increased by maximizing the density of resonance states and bandwidth of the resonance chain together. We discovered this remarkable computing while studying the human brain, so we present a new model of the human brain in terms of an experimentally determined resonance chain with bandwidth 10-15 Hz (complete brain with all sensors) to 10+15 Hz (DNA) along with its implementation using a pure organic synthesis of entire computer (brain jelly) in our lab, software prototype as proof of concept and finally a new fourth circuit element (Hinductor) based beyond Complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) hardware is also presented.},

Nutation removal, attitude control and fast large angle maneuvers have been demonstrated and shown to be effective using a model of a commercially available single standard cold gas pulse width modulated controlled thruster. Maximum final impact angle due to drift and residual velocities was found to be less than 5 degrees and the maximum angle of attack to be 4 deg. The conventional 3-axis control would require as many as twelve thrusters a more substantial structure with complex pipe-work, and a more sophisticated controller. The single thruster concept reduces launch mass and thus cost of the mission, making the concept of small networked surface probes for extended science missions more viable. Experiments based on computer simulation have shown that strict design and mission profile requirements can be fulfilled using the single thruster control method.},

  abstract = {Pressures on natural resources are increasing and a number of challenges need to be overcome to meet the needs of a growing population in a period of environmental variability. Some of these environmental issues can be monitored using remotely sensed Earth Observations (EO) data that are increasingly available from a number of freely and openly accessible repositories. However, the full information potential of EO data has not been yet realized. They remain still underutilized mainly because of their complexity, increasing volume, and the lack of efficient processing capabilities. EO Data Cubes (DC) are a new paradigm aiming to realize the full potential of EO data by lowering the barriers caused by these Big data challenges and providing access to large spatio-temporal data in an analysis ready form. Systematic and regular provision of Analysis Ready Data (ARD) will significantly reduce the burden on EO data users. Nevertheless, ARD are not commonly produced by data providers and therefore getting uniform and consistent ARD remains a challenging task. This paper presents an approach to enable rapid data access and pre-processing to generate ARD using interoperable services chains. The approach has been tested and validated generating Landsat ARD while building the Swiss Data Cube.},

Our method, implemented in an actual system, includes the following steps. The user submits a query over an underlying star schema. Taking this query as input, the system comes up with a set of queries complementing the information content of the original query, and executes them. Then, the system visualizes the query results and accompanies this presentation with a text commenting on the result highlights. Moreover, via a text-to-speech conversion the system automatically produces audio for the constructed text. Each combination of visualization, text and audio practically constitutes a cube movie, which is wrapped as a PowerPoint presentation and returned to the user.},

This tutorial surveys neural network models from the perspective of natural language processing research, in an attempt to bring natural-language researchers up to speed with the neural techniques. The tutorial covers input encoding for natural language tasks, feed-forward networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks and recursive networks, as well as the computation graph abstraction for automatic gradient computation.},

  author = {Goldstein, Isaac and Lewenstein, Moshe and Porat, Ely},
  year = {2019},
  month = oct,
  abstract = {In the SetDisjointness problem, a collection of \$m\$ sets \$S\_1,S\_2,...,S\_m\$ from some universe \$U\$ is preprocessed in order to answer queries on the emptiness of the intersection of some two query sets from the collection. In the SetIntersection variant, all the elements in the intersection of the query sets are required to be reported. These are two fundamental problems that were considered in several papers from both the upper bound and lower bound perspective. Several conditional lower bounds for these problems were proven for the tradeoff between preprocessing and query time or the tradeoff between space and query time. Moreover, there are several unconditional hardness results for these problems in some specific computational models. The fundamental nature of the SetDisjointness and SetIntersection problems makes them useful for proving the conditional hardness of other problems from various areas. However, the universe of the elements in the sets may be very large, which may cause the reduction to some other problems to be inefficient and therefore it is not useful for proving their conditional hardness. In this paper, we prove the conditional hardness of SetDisjointness and SetIntersection with bounded universe. This conditional hardness is shown for both the interplay between preprocessing and query time and the interplay between space and query time. Moreover, we present several applications of these new conditional lower bounds. These applications demonstrates the strength of our new conditional lower bounds as they exploit the limited universe size. We believe that this new framework of conditional lower bounds with bounded universe can be useful for further significant applications.},

The feasibility of a 100-year lifespan space mission is taken as the guiding thread for the discussion. Such a mission, defined with a few preliminary requirements, could be used to deliver messages to our descendants regardless of the on-ground contingencies. After the analysis of the main threats for long endurance in space, including radiation, debris and micrometeoroids, atmospheric drag and thermal environment, the available solutions are investigated. A trade-off study analyses orbital profiles from the point of view of radiation, thermal stability and decay rate, providing best locations to maximize lifespan. Special attention is also paid to on-board power, in terms of energy harvesting and accumulation, highlighting the limitations of current assets, i.e. solar panels and batteries, and revealing possible future solutions. Furthermore, the review includes electronics, non-volatile memories and communication elements, which need extra hardening against radiation and thermal cycling if extra-long endurance is required. As a result of the analysis, a century-lifetime mission is depicted by putting together all the reviewed concepts. The satellite, equipped with reliability enhanced elements and system-level solutions such as smart hibernation policies, could provide limited but still useful performance after a 100-year flight.},

To provide the various viewpoints for the analysts, these data are organized as a multi-dimensional data model called data cubes. Each cell in a data cube represents a unique set of values for the different dimensions and contains the metrics of interest. The different abstraction and concretization associated with a dimension may be represented as lattice. The focus is to move up and drill down within the lattice using an algorithm with optimal space and computation. In the lattice of cuboids, there exist multiple paths for summarization from a lower to an upper level of cuboid. The alternate paths involve different amounts of storage space and different volume of computations. Thus objective of this paper is to design an algorithm for formal analysis leading towards detection of an optimal path for any two given valid pair of cuboids at different levels. Algorithm is proposed based on branch and bound method for selection of optimal path. Experimental results in the last show that the solution obtained by the algorithm gives the optimal solution in terms of space and time computation.},

The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube. Many of these features are being added to the SQL Standard.},

In order to find someone's phone number with a 50\% probability, any classical algorithm (whether deterministic or probabilistic) will need to look at a minimum of N/2 names. Quantum mechanical systems can be in a superposition of states and simultaneously examine multiple names. By properly adjusting the phases of various operations, successful computations reinforce each other while others interfere randomly. As a result, the desired phone number can be obtained in only O(sqrt(N)) steps. The algorithm is within a small constant factor of the fastest possible quantum mechanical algorithm.},

Based on this review, we identify two socio-technical features of big data that influence value realization: portability and interconnectivity. We argue that, in practice, organizations need to continuously realign work practices, organizational models, and stakeholder interests in order to reap the benefits from big data.

  abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling the implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of applications for which quantum computers have an established advantage. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.\&rsquo;s quantum approximate optimization algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost function based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the quantum alternating operator ansatz, is the consideration of general parameterized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach, in the spirit of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. In addition to introducing the quantum alternating operator ansatz, we lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide a compendium with brief descriptions of mappings for a diverse array of problems.},

The problem has recently received significant attention because of its relevance to a wide variety of data management problems. In query optimization, finding a rewriting of a query using a set of materialized views can yield a more efficient query execution plan. To support the separation of the logical and physical views of data, a storage schema can be described using views over the logical schema. As a result, finding a query execution plan that accesses the storage amounts to solving the problem of answering queries using views. Finally, the problem arises in data integration systems, where data sources can be described as precomputed views over a mediated schema. This article surveys the state of the art on the problem of answering queries using views, and synthesizes the disparate works into a coherent framework. We describe the different applications of the problem, the algorithms proposed to solve it and the relevant theoretical results.},

  abstract = {Real-time surveillance systems, telecommunication systems, and other dynamic environments often generate tremendous (potentially infinite) volume of stream data: the volume is too huge to be scanned multiple times. Much of such data resides at rather low level of abstraction, whereas most analysts are interested in relatively high-level dynamic changes (such as trends and outliers). To discover such high-level characteristics, one may need to perform on-line multi-level, multi-dimensional analytical processing of stream data. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called stream\_cube, to facilitate on-line, multi-dimensional, multi-level analysis of stream data.For fast online multi-dimensional analysis of stream data, three important techniques are proposed for efficient and effective computation of stream cubes. First, a tilted time frame model is proposed as a multi-resolution model to register time-related data: the more recent data are registered at finer resolution, whereas the more distant data are registered at coarser resolution. This design reduces the overall storage of time-related data and adapts nicely to the data analysis tasks commonly encountered in practice. Second, instead of materializing cuboids at all levels, we propose to maintain a small number of critical layers. Flexible analysis can be efficiently performed based on the concept of observation layer and minimal interesting layer. Third, an efficient stream data cubing algorithm is developed which computes only the layers (cuboids) along a popular path and leaves the other cuboids for query-driven, on-line computation. Based on this design methodology, stream data cube can be constructed and maintained incrementally with a reasonable amount of memory, computation cost, and query response time. This is verified by our substantial performance study.},

The performance of view selection algorithm is usually measured by three criteria: (1) the amount of memory to store the selected views, (2) the query response time and (3) the time complexity of this algorithm. The two first measurements deal with the output of the algorithm. No existing solutions give good trade-off between amount of memory and queries cost with a small time complexity. We propose in this paper an algorithm guaranteeing a constant approximation factor of queries response time with respect to the optimal solution. Moreover, the time complexity for a D-dimensional fact table is O (D * 2D) corresponding to the fastest known algorithm. We provide an experimental comparison with two other well known algorithms showing that our approach also gives good performance in terms of memory.},

  abstract = {Decision support applications involve complex queries on very large databases. Since response times should be small, query optimization is critical. Users typically view the data as multidimensional data cubes. Each cell of the data cube is a view consisting of an aggregation of interest, like total sales. The values of many of these cells are dependent on the values of other cells in the data cube. A common and powerful query optimization technique is to materialize some or all of these cells rather than compute them from raw data each time. Commercial systems differ mainly in their approach to materializing the data cube. In this paper, we investigate the issue of which cells (views) to materialize when it is too expensive to materialize all views. A lattice framework is used to express dependencies among views. We present greedy algorithms that work off this lattice and determine a good set of views to materialize. The greedy algorithm performs within a small constant factor of optimal under a variety of models. We then consider the most common case of the hypercube lattice and examine the choice of materialized views for hypercubes in detail, giving some good tradeoffs between the space used and the average time to answer a query.},

  abstract = {In flight control, as with any human in the loop system, operator error is an inevitable reality. On the International Space Station (ISS) where crew time and physical resources are precious and often irreplaceable, operator errors can result in significant, irreversible consequences. Flight controllers at the Payload Operations Integration Center (POIC) located at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama know this reality well. At the POIC, operator errors can be caused by a variety of factors, from poor hardware or software design to environmental factors such as time pressure or fatigue. The most difficult errors to address, however, are those which result from ineffective teamwork. To address these teamwork errors, trainers at the POIC have drawn best practices from high reliability industries as well as from our sister ISS control center at the Johnson Space Center (JSC) in Houston, Texas, to develop and implement a new training program focused specifically on teamwork skills. This training program, called Team Skills Training, is inspired by modern and historical training programs developed by NASA and is specifically tailored to the needs of the payload operations flight control team at the POIC. The program consists of training for both certified and trainee flight controllers, and covers team skills topics such as situational awareness, leadership, and communication skills. To maximize effectiveness, the program uses novel instructional techniques which extend beyond the classroom to encourage students to apply what they have learned to their day to day work. Minimizing operator errors in flight control is an endeavor which requires constant vigilance and continuous improvement. At the POIC, Team Skills Training is an important step in this journey.},

A number of other solar activity indicators also vary in association with the sunspots including; the 10.7 cm radio flux, the total solar irradiance, the magnetic field, flares and coronal mass ejections, geomagnetic activity, galactic cosmic ray fluxes, and radioisotopes in tree rings and ice cores. Individual solar cycles are characterized by their maxima and minima, cycle periods and amplitudes, cycle shape, the equatorward drift of the active latitudes, hemispheric asymmetries, and active longitudes. Cycle-to-cycle variability includes the Maunder Minimum, the Gleissberg Cycle, and the Gnevyshev\textendash Ohl (even-odd) Rule. Short-term variability includes the 154-day periodicity, quasi-biennial variations, and double-peaked maxima. We conclude with an examination of prediction techniques for the solar cycle and a closer look at cycles 23 and 24.},

To achieve these goals, NASA is developing the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion crew capsule as key elements in the architecture for missions to the moon and Mars. However, these aggressive goals are complicated by the need to optimize the use of government resources during a period when budgets are challenged. This paper discusses potential near-term missions that leverage Orion and SLS, as well as the Lunar Orbital Platform - Gateway, in order to establish an outpost on the lunar surface, as part of the overall campaign to eventually reach Mars. This proposed campaign of lunar surface missions will create an outpost that can then be resupplied by commercial cargo and crew providers, while SLS and Orion continue to deliver the large components needed at the Gateway to test Mars exploration systems, finally culminating in a crewed Mars mission. \textcopyright{} 2019 IEEE.},

Such arrays are composed of many free flying spacecraft, and accurate knowledge of their relative positions is necessary for proper data analysis. By using signals from existing Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites, each individual spacecraft may record data that can be used to solve for precise orbit determination (POD) solutions to determine the relative propagation delays between each spacecraft pair. Any errors in the position are translated into phase error of the complex correlation data. The acceptable limits of error in position before harming the localization of the radio array are tested, using localization performance of SunRISE as a test case. This work help sets requirements for future space based arrays, particularly the quality of GNSS signal needed on each spacecraft as well as correlator capabilities. It is found that there are several feasible hardware and software combinations available today that could constitute a space based array, and recommendations are provided on which combinations would be well suited for various correlation strategies.},

  abstract = {The Earths Ionosphere limits radio measurements on its surface, blocking out any radiation below 10 MHz. Valuable insight into many astrophysical processes could be gained by having a radio interferometer in space to image the low frequency window, which has never been achieved. One application for such a system is observing type II bursts that track solar energetic particle acceleration occurring at Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-driven shocks. In this work we create a data processing pipeline for the pathfinder mission SunRISE, a 6 CubeSat interferometer to circle the Earth in a GEO graveyard orbit, and evaluate its performance in localizing type II bursts with a simulated CME. Traditional radio astronomy software is hard coded to assume an Earth based array. To circumvent this, we manually calculate the antenna separations and insert them along with the simulated visibilities into a CASA MS file for analysis. We model the response of different array configurations over the 25 hour orbit, combining an ephemeris for the Sun with simulated recovered positions of spacecraft using GPS localization to get the array geometry into the correct frame for processing. We include realistic thermal noise dominated by the galactic background at these low frequencies, as well as new sources of phase noise from positional uncertainty of each spacecraft. To create realistic virtual type II input data, we employ a 2-temperature MHD simulation of the May 13th 2005 CME event, and superimpose realistic radio emission models on the CME-driven shock front, and propagate the signal through the simulated array. Data cuts based on different plasma parameter thresholds (e.g. de Hoffman-Teller velocity and angle between shock normal and the upstream magnetic field) are tested to get the best match to the true recorded emission. We test simulated trajectories of SunRISE and image what the array recovers, comparing it to the virtual input, finding that SunRISE can resolve the source of type II emission to within its prescribed goal of 1/3 the CME width more than 99\% of the time with 5 or 6 spacecraft, and 97.5\% of the time with 4 spacecraft.},

  abstract = {Data streams become more and more important in modern computer infrastructures. The amount of data processed by computer systems continuously increased in the past years, in a way that storing all of the data is not effective or even impossible. Consequently the most feasible way to get information out of the data is to compute it in a stream processing manner.  This paper proposes an iceberg cube algorithm which is able to compute an incremental iceberg cube with every new data record in a window of a stream. An iceberg cube is a data cube in which all attribute value combinations have to fulfill an aggregation condition. In contrast to many algorithms which use a combination of sorting and partitioning, the new PopUp-Cubing algorithm uses hashing to find the right cells for aggregation. PopUp-Cubing supports pruning in the incremental iceberg cube and is able to perform multi-dimensional simultaneous aggregation. Additionally, PopUp-Cubing has an indicator for cells that pop up or submerge at the metaphorical water surface of an iceberg cube. This happens, if the aggregated value of cells changes over time. This indicator can help to identify important changes in a data stream. The algorithm is evaluated with a network flow dataset. As the results will show, the new PopUp-Cubing algorithm outperforms a batch like algorithm that computes every window by a factor of about 360.},

The present study considers a variation to the ranging technique presented in [1] in order to facilitate implementation in a software-defined radio (SDR). This implementation tracks an uplink PN range code and measures the code phase coincident with the start of downlink telemetry frames. The phase is then embedded in subsequent telemetry frames. The method is implemented in the JHU/APL Frontier Radio and leverages the PN ranging design from the NASA New Horizons communications system.

Visual perception of an environment, is an important capability for mobile robots, so many efforts are leading the research community for such a fundamental and challenging task. An aspect to emphasize is that vision systems have to cope with uncertainty because sensors have noise and the previous knowledge is unclear or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty estimation model applied to an object detection system. The vision system is designed to recognize objects in usual human environments, working on a mobile robot. To calculate the uncertainty, we consider the model accuracy of the system, the probability of detection after the prediction process and the empirical probability of detecting each object according to the distance. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of incorporating uncertainty information into an object detection system. Finally, the results motivate us to continue improving the uncertainty model in order to use the information generated to strengthen mobile robot navigation systems, as well as for the development of a place categorization system.},

BridgeSat's mission is to speed adoption of optical communications systems by providing operators with a turnkey solution that seamlessly connects satellites to the ground, and accommodates accelerating demand for accurate and frequent data collection from LEO satellites. Satellite Operators login to the BridgeSat web page to view and edit daily data volume downlink requirements and view the status of prior downlinks. The BridgeSat server automates routine daily planning of laser communication contacts to multiple satellites for multiple ground stations by calling Orbit Logic's STK Scheduler COTS application, which provides the scheduling engine for the system pulling data from Bridgesat's proprietary global weather prediction sensors and algorithms. The planning server generates an optimized, validated schedule that is transmitted to each satellite operator and ground telescope for execution. Events drive updates to scheduling including new or modified downlink needs, station maintenance blackouts, weather changes, or actual data downlink volumes (which can vary from planned volumes). Replanning can also be triggered by BridgeSat operators. The impact of changing cloud cover forecasts, lead-time requirements for spacecraft uplinks, and variable high downlink rates which can dramatically change downlink volumes in real time, drove the need for responsive replanning on a regular basis. The solution supports BridgeSat operators, customer technical personnel, and administrators, through configurable permissions and data access rights.},

  abstract = {The Boeing Company is designing, developing and manufacturing the Core Stage and Avionics for NASA's heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which will support missions beyond low earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo days. On the SLS vehicle many sensors are selected and used to provide critical information for testing, ground operations, and vehicle flight environments. Appropriate data acquisition systems that can interface and process the selected sensors is important to the success of the program. In this program, multiple data acquisition systems are used to interface with sensors at various development stages of the SLS vehicle, and at different sensor criticality levels. These phased configurations of data acquisition classes and complexity range from gathering sensor data during system level testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), to transmitting flight information after liftoff at the Kennedy Space Center. One challenge that engineers are faced with pertains to how the data acquisition system is defined prior to understanding the quantity and type of sensors required for the application. This paper focuses mainly on the SLS flight system and provides a general overview of the system architecture. The paper also addresses the strategy used to define the data acquisition system, along with the methodology for selecting data acquisition cards that fit with the application.},

The Resource Description Framework (RDF) serves as the foundation for the publication of a growing amount of semantic web data still largely untapped by data analysis. RDF data, however, do not typically follow an MD structure and, therefore, elude traditional OLAP. We propose an approach for superimposing MD structures over arbitrary RDF datasets. On top of that, we present a high-level querying mechanism to express MD queries, which can be automatically translated into SPARQL queries over the source data. As a consequence, data analysts that are unfamiliar with SPARQL may still incorporate RDF data sources into the analysis. Superimposed MD schemas also serve as foundation for Semantic Web Analysis Graphs which capture analysis processes for increased self-service capabilities.},

By using a novel approach of examining the assembly language and other intermediate files generated by the compilation process, it has been successfully demonstrated that the compiler's processing of the high-level source code can create a vulnerable end product. Proper software assurance is intended to provide confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, and compiler-induced vulnerabilities reduce this confidence level. The discovered vulnerabilities can be related to standard vulnerability classes, side channel attacks, undefined behavior, and persistent state violations. Additionally, the research revealed that the executable machine code generated by the compiler can differ in structure from the original source code due to simplifications and optimizations performed during the compilation process that cannot be disabled. This research examined both the open-source GNU C compiler and the Microsoft C/C++ compiler that is part of the Microsoft Visual Studio package. Both of these compilers are widely used and represent typical compilers in use today.},

PyCubed addresses many hardwarerelated failure modes through component and system-level radiation testing, in-depth design and qualification documentation, and flight heritage on a successful LEO mission. The challenge of flight software development is also mitigated through the use of the Python programming language via CircuitPython. Python enables dramatically simplified CubeSat software development, allowing students and researchers to quickly and reliably integrate new sensors, control algorithms, and payload hardware into their missions. All design files, including additional design justifications and reliability documentation, are available on the project's GitHub site.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning (ML) provides approaches which use big data to enable algorithms to ``learn'', producing outputs which would be difficult to obtain otherwise. Despite the advances allowed by ML, much recent attention has been paid to certain qualities of ML solutions, particularly fairness and transparency, but also qualities such as privacy, security, and testability. From a requirements engineering (RE) perspective, such qualities are also known as non-functional requirements (NFRs). In RE, the meaning of certain NFRs, how to refine those NFRs, and how to use NFRs for design and runtime decision making over traditional software is relatively well established and understood. However, in a context where the solution involves ML, much of our knowledge about NFRs no longer applies. First, the types of NFRs we are concerned with undergo a shift: NFRs like fairness and transparency become prominent, whereas other NFRs such as modularity may become less relevant. The meanings and interpretations of NFRs in an ML context (e.g., maintainability, interoperability, and usability) must be rethought, including how these qualities are decomposed into sub-qualities. Tradeoffs between NFRs in an ML context must be re-examined. Beyond the changing landscape of NFRs, we can ask if our known approaches to understanding, formalizing, modeling, and reasoning over NFRs at design and runtime must also be adjusted, or can be applied as-is to this new area? Given these questions, this work outlines challenges and a proposed research agenda for the exploration of NFRs for ML-based solutions.},

  abstract = {Quantum mechanics has irked physicists ever since its conception more than 100 years ago. While some of the misgivings, such as it being unintuitive, are merely aesthetic, quantum mechanics has one serious shortcoming: it lacks a physical description of the measurement process. This "measurement problem" indicates that quantum mechanics is at least an incomplete theory -- good as far as it goes, but missing a piece -- or, more radically, is in need of complete overhaul. Here we describe an approach which may provide this sought-for completion or replacement: Superdeterminism. A superdeterministic theory is one which violates the assumption of Statistical Independence (that distributions of hidden variables are independent of measurement settings). Intuition suggests that Statistical Independence is an essential ingredient of any theory of science (never mind physics), and for this reason Superdeterminism is typically discarded swiftly in any discussion of quantum foundations. The purpose of this paper is to explain why the existing objections to Superdeterminism are based on experience with classical physics and linear systems, but that this experience misleads us. Superdeterminism is a promising approach not only to solve the measurement problem, but also to understand the apparent nonlocality of quantum physics. Most importantly, we will discuss how it may be possible to test this hypothesis in an (almost) model independent way.},

Quantum-behaved pigeon-inspired optimization (QPIO) has been widely applied to such nonlinear problems. However, conventional QPIO is suffering low global convergence speed and local optimum. In order to solve the above problems, an improved QPIO algorithm, adaptive operator QPIO, is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a new initialization process based on logistic mapping method is introduced to generate the initial population of the pigeon-swarm. After that, to improve the performance of the map and compass operation, the factor parameter will be adaptively updated in each iteration, which can balance the ability between global and local search. In the final landmark operation, the gradual decreasing pigeon population-updating strategy is introduced to prevent premature convergence and local optimum. Finally, the demonstration of the proposed algorithm on UAV path planning problem is presented, and the comparison result indicates that the performance of our algorithm is better than that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), pigeon-inspired optimization (PIO), and its variants, in terms of convergence and accuracy.},

The pre-computation of data cubes is critical for improving the OLAP response time of in large high-dimensional data warehouses. However, as the sizes of data warehouses grow, the time it takes to perform this pre-computation becomes a significant performance bottleneck. In a high dimensional data warehouse, it might not be practical to build all these cuboids and their indices. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical cubing algorithm to partition the high dimensional data cube into low dimensional cube segments. It permits a significant reduction of CPU and I/O overhead for many queries by restricting the number of cube segments to be processed for both the fact table and bitmap indices. Experimental results show that the proposed method is significantly more efficient than other existing cubing methods.},

Slideable platforms on rollers that can be reconfigured, upgraded and retrofitted with prefabricated hardware can be placed into operation in-situ in the ISS. This study will provide a solution to the exiting berthing docking system for delivery of larger hardware to ISS. The doubledoor delivery system concept is presented, including considerations for materials used, construction method, and the mechanism's detailed design is discussed.},

  abstract = {In multidimensional data models intended for online analytic processing (OLAP), data are viewed as points in a multidimensional space. Each dimension has structure, described by a directed graph of categories, a set of members for each category, and a child/parent relation between members. An important application of this structure is to use it to infer summarizability, that is, whether an aggregate view defined for some category can be correctly derived from a set of precomputed views defined for other categories. A dimension is called structurally heterogeneous if two members in a given category are allowed to have ancestors in different categories. In this article, we propose a class of integrity constraints, dimension constraints, that allow us to reason about summarizability in heterogeneous dimensions. We introduce the notion of frozen dimensions which are minimal homogeneous dimension instances representing the different structures that are implicitly combined in a heterogeneous dimension. Frozen dimensions provide the basis for efficiently testing the implication of dimension constraints and are a useful aid to understanding heterogeneous dimensions. We give a sound and complete algorithm for solving the implication of dimension constraints that uses heuristics based on the structure of the dimension and the constraints to speed up its execution. We study the intrinsic complexity of the implication problem and the running time of our algorithm.},

  abstract = {Increasingly encompassing models have been suggested for our world. Theories range from generally accepted to increasingly speculative to apparently bogus. The progression of theories from ego- to geo- to helio-centric models to universe and multiverse theories and beyond was accompanied by a dramatic increase in the sizes of the postulated worlds, with humans being expelled from their center to ever more remote and random locations. Rather than leading to a true theory of everything, this trend faces a turning point after which the predictive power of such theories decreases (actually to zero). Incorporating the location and other capacities of the observer into such theories avoids this problem and allows to distinguish meaningful from predictively meaningless theories. This also leads to a truly complete theory of everything consisting of a (conventional objective) theory of everything plus a (novel subjective) observer process. The observer localization is neither based on the controversial anthropic principle, nor has it anything to do with the quantum-mechanical observation process. The suggested principle is extended to more practical (partial, approximate, probabilistic, parametric) world models (rather than theories of everything). Finally, I provide a justification of Ockham's razor, and criticize the anthropic principle, the doomsday argument, the no free lunch theorem, and the falsifiability dogma.},

This informationtheoretic approach solidifies the foundations of inductive inference and artificial intelligence. Getting the foundations right usually marks a significant progress and maturing of a field. The theory provides a gold standard and guidance for researchers working on intelligent algorithms. The roots of universal induction have been laid exactly half-a-century ago and the roots of universal intelligence exactly one decade ago. So it is timely to take stock of what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Since there are already good recent surveys, I describe the state-of-the-art only in passing and refer the reader to the literature.

The LET joints are used to distribute the mechanical stress of a rigid planar material to form a flexible planar spring structure. The proposed antenna has monopole-like omnidirectional linearly polarized gain patterns in planar mode. Its gain value is about 0.5 dBi at 5.8 GHz. In folded mode, the antenna has about a circularly polarized gain value of about 8.07 dBic and broadside radiation patterns. The measured crosspolarization suppression ratio is about 25 dB, and the axial ratio (AR) value is 1.13 dB at 5.8 GHz.

  abstract = {Telemetry data received from satellites during in-orbit operation are typically analyzed by experts to identify faults that might lead to potential subsystem failures. A typical method is to apply limit-checking procedure to locate off-nominal features which do not fall within the expected normal range of values. Human-experts' analysis is usually limited. It focuses on analyzing selected group of features that would interpret a specific situation that might be taking place onboard the satellite. When the size of telemetry features and number of observations are in the order of hundreds or thousands, a full expert-based analysis is almost impossible to achieve. In this paper, expert-based analysis is leveraged by the automation of the telemetry analysis process based on a machine learning technique called the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a pattern recognition and classification approach that combines ideas and concepts from optimization, combinatorics and Boolean functions. One of the main advantages of LAD is its explanatory power, which offers a classification and an interpretation of the root causes of the events under study. Patterns generated via LAD are easily understood by experts as they are constructed from the features within the set of observations. Consequently, LAD is used in numerous practical applications. We are applying LAD in the process of fault diagnosis and prognosis in satellites by combining the domain expert's knowledge and the knowledge extracted by LAD. The procedure begins by performing a fault tree analysis (FTA) and a list of corrective actions, by domain human experts. This analysis is usually limited by the expert's knowledge to represent known faulty states of the system. However, operation data collected over a period of time can introduce meaningful hidden knowledge about faulty states that were not represented in the original FTA. We apply LAD to find this hidden knowledge in data collected through simulation, testing and in-flight operation. The results reflect significant interpretation power and an effective leverage of the obtained knowledge by the integrated telemetry analysis tool when compared to traditional limit-checking method.},

Due to its complexity, these types of systems are designed in a way to mitigate errors and maneuver the critical situations. Spacecraft delivers to the ground operator an abundance data related to system status telemetry; the telemetry parameters are monitored to indicate spacecraft performance. Recently, researchers proposed using Machine Learning (ML)/Telemetry Mining (TM) techniques for telemetry parameters forecasting. Telemetry processing facilitates the data visualization to enable operators understanding the behavior of the satellite in order to reduce failure risks. In this paper, we introduce a comparison between the different machine learning techniques that can be applied for low earth orbit satellite telemetry mining. The techniques are evaluated on the bases of calculating the prediction accuracy using mean error and correlation estimation. We used telemetry data received from Egyptsat-1 satellite including parameters such as battery temperature, power bus voltage and load current. The research summarizes the performance of processing telemetry data using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM RNN), Deep Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks (DLSTM RNNs), Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Network (GRU RNN), and Deep Gated Recurrent Unit Recurrent Neural Networks (DGRU RNNs).},

In this research, we address the topic of using machine learning techniques to diagnose faults of satellite subsystems using its telemetry parameters. The case study and source of telemetry are acquired from Egyptsat-1 satellite which has been launched April 2007 and lost communication with ground station last 2010. We applied Machine learning techniques in order to identify operating modes and corresponding telemetry parameters. We used Support Vector Machine for Regression to analyze the satellite performance; then a fault diagnosis approach is applied to determine the most probable reason of this satellite failure. Telemetry data is clustered using k-means clustering algorithm in combination with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) function for dimensionality reduction. We classified data using Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) in order to generate positive patterns for each failure class which is used to determine probability failure cause for each telemetry parameter.

This requires the crew to re-plan day-to-day activities, particularly in the case of unforeseen circumstances. To support these planning duties, we are developing a mixed-initiative planning tool that optimizes schedules in collaboration with astronauts. This paper highlights the tool's planning algorithm. The planning algorithm has two closely-coupled components: first, an optimization algorithm (optimizer) based on local search heuristics and, secondly, a computational model of the work that is to be performed. In this framework, the optimizer acts as a surrogate model of the more detailed computational models, such that new solutions can be efficiently explored. The computational work model is capable of simulating a plan through time, and can account for dynamic interactions between activities and work environment that are not modeled in the optimizer. Moreover, the computational model returns to the optimizer metrics that reflect required teamwork to coordinate activities between astronauts. The paper includes a description of the optimizer and computational simulation models as well as a case study with activities, agents and resources that are representative of a typical manned mission. \textcopyright{} 2019 IEEE.},

The 6U CubeSat is currently in orbit and features a radar payload built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and a spacecraft bus and operations provided by Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems. Following the deployment of the half-meter parabolic antenna, the radar first observed precipitation over Mexico a month later. The mission has met its technology demonstration requirements and continues to collect precipitation data. This paper discusses the project engineering processes through formulation, implementation, and flight operations and concludes with lessons learned and future concepts.},

  abstract = {Set intersection is one of the most important operations for many applications such as Web search engines or database management systems. This paper describes our new algorithm to efficiently find set intersections with sorted arrays on modern processors with SIMD instructions and high branch misprediction penalties. Our algorithm efficiently exploits SIMD instructions and can drastically reduce branch mispredictions. Our algorithm extends a merge-based algorithm by reading multiple elements, instead of just one element, from each of two input arrays and compares all of the pairs of elements from the two arrays to find the elements with the same values. The key insight for our improvement is that we can reduce the number of costly hard-to-predict conditional branches by advancing a pointer by more than one element at a time. Although this algorithm increases the total number of comparisons, we can execute these comparisons more efficiently using the SIMD instructions and gain the benefits of the reduced branch misprediction overhead. Our algorithm is suitable to replace existing standard library functions, such as std::set\_intersection in C++, thus accelerating many applications, because the algorithm is simple and requires no preprocessing to generate additional data structures. We implemented our algorithm on Xeon and POWER7+. The experimental results show our algorithm outperforms the std::set\_intersection implementation delivered with gcc by up to 5.2x using SIMD instructions and by up to 2.1x even without using SIMD instructions for 32-bit and 64-bit integer datasets. Our SIMD algorithm also outperformed an existing algorithm that can leverage SIMD instructions.},

We also developed a GUI which directly controls both RF and IR systems, azimuth motion, as well as performs post-processing for data integration and location finding. RF range data and LWIR images were collected simultaneously by using our configured sensor system as azimuth was varied from 0 to 70\&deg;. Series of collected RF data was transformed into a single 2-D radar image showing range profile of targets against azimuth. For LWIR, data was aligned into a single panoramic image as a function of azimuth by incorporating shift parameters observed in the measurements. Both RF/IR images were then arranged into a 3-D datacube, having azimuth as a common domain, and this datacube directly provided locational information of targets. For demonstration, we successfully located objects such as a corner reflector and a blackbody source under a dark background. In addition, we highlight some additional features available in our sensor system including target classification using both Euclidean and SVM based multi-classifier techniques, and tracking capability for region of interest on moving targets. Future work would be to improve the current system for outdoor measurement to locate distant targets.},

  abstract = {Data return is a metric that is commonly publicized for all space science missions. In the early days of the Space Program, this figure was small, and could be described in bits or maybe even megabits. But now, missions are capable of returning data volumes two or three orders of magnitude larger. For example, Voyager 1 and 2 combined produced a little over 5 Terabits of data in 39 years of operation. In contrast, the Cassini mission, launched two decades after Voyager, produced about one and a half times those data volumes in half the time. NISAR, an Earth Science Mission currently in implementation, plans to produce over 28 Petabits of raw data in just 3 years. This means that NISAR will produce about as many data in 30 days as the combined data production of nearly all planetary missions to date. These increases in capability are a result of technology enhancements in two main areas: telecommunications architecture (both space and ground segments) and data storage technology. This paper describes the progression of these two technologies over the course of more than three decades of space missions and provides additional insight into the design of the end-to-end NISAR Data System Architecture. Trends in the data are briefly explored and compared to Moore's Law which provides only a qualitative model for memory growth but not for data production. In summary, early missions are found to be driven by unrefined processes while later missions, having utilized earlier lessons learned, focus more on improvements to flight and ground capabilities. Data return seems to fall into three categories. First, deep space missions are driven by the large distances that limit data return to the Earth. Next, the orbiter infrastructure around Mars helps these missions generate more data than other deep space spacecraft. Finally, near-Earth missions have the greatest capabilities for the studied metrics due to their close proximity to Earth and the ground network availability.},

  abstract = {The Kepler telescope launched into orbit in March 2009, initiating NASA's first mission to discover Earth-size planets orbiting Sun-like stars. Kepler simultaneously collected data for 160,000 target stars at a time over its four-year mission, identifying over 4700 planet candidates, 2300 confirmed or validated planets, and over 2100 eclipsing binaries. While Kepler was designed to discover exoplanets, the long term, ultra-high photometric precision measurements it achieved made it a premier observational facility for stellar astrophysics, especially in the field of asteroseismology, and for variable stars, such as RR Lyraes. The Kepler Science Operations Center (SOC) was developed at NASA Ames Research Center to process the data acquired by Kepler from pixel-level calibrations all the way to identifying transiting planet signatures and subjecting them to a suite of diagnostic tests to establish or break confidence in their planetary nature. Detecting small, rocky planets transiting Sun-like stars presents a variety of daunting challenges, from achieving an unprecedented photometric precision of 20 parts per million (ppm) on 6.5-hour timescales, supporting the science operations, management, processing, and repeated reprocessing of the accumulating data stream. This paper describes how the design of the SOC meets these varied challenges, discusses the architecture of the SOC and how the SOC pipeline is operated and is run on the NAS Pleiades supercomputer, and summarizes the most important pipeline features addressing the multiple computational, image and signal processing challenges posed by Kepler.},

The second technique, called CubeMiner, is a novel algorithm that operates on the 3D space directly. We have implemented both schemes, and evaluated their performance on both real and synthetic datasets. The experimental results show that the RSM-based scheme is efficient when one of the dimensions is small, while CubeMiner is superior otherwise.},

  abstract = {The information available to agents using decentralized task allocation algorithms plays an important role in how assignments can be constructed. The requirement that information be globally consistent across all agents can be leveraged to allow cooperation on coupled objectives. In environments where global information consistency assumptions are difficult to enforce, the alternative is to rely only on a local best estimate of the global information state, which is referred to here as local information consistency. Algorithms that assume only this local information consistency will have reduced optimization capabilities compared to their global information assumption counterparts. Specifically, if objective functions are non-submodular, local information algorithms may produce arbitrarily bad allocations or, in the case of many algorithms, may not even converge. The key contribution of this paper is an algorithm termed bid warped consensus-based bundle algorithm that converges for all deterministic objective functions and has nontrivial performance guarantees for submodular and some non-submodular objective functions. Included in this paper is an analytical analysis of both convergence and performance of the algorithm, as well as a numerical comparison to several other competing local and global information approaches.},

Especially we utilize our Linux-based ARINC-653, which can provide abundant development tools, software libraries, and device drivers due to the nature of Linux. Our control and mission software include Operational Flight Program (OFP), Video Streaming Program (VSP), Ground Control Program (GCP), and Ground Monitoring Program (GMP). We test our programs in a HILS environment and show that these run correctly in terms of functionality and real-time requirements. Our study also suggests few extensions for process scheduling and inter-partition communication of ARINC 653.},

Therefore, many organizations are entering the space sector due to the paradigm shift caused by nanosatellites. Despite the reduced size of these spacecrafts, their Flight Software (FSW) complexity is not proportional to the satellite volume, thus creating a great barrier for the entrance of new players on the nanosatellite market. On the other side, there are some available frameworks that can provide mature FSW design approaches, implying in considerable reduction in software project timeframe and cost. This paper presents a comparative survey between six relevant flight software frameworks, compared according to commonly required `New Space' criteria, and finally points out the most suitable one to the VCUB1 reference nanosatellite mission.},

  abstract = {Amazonia-1 is the first Remote Sensing Satellite entirely  developed at Brazil by National Institute for Space Research  (INPE) and it is expected to be concluded in 2018. Amazonia-1 is a  polar orbit satellite that will generate images with a 5 days  revisit period. To do this, has a wide sight optical imager,  called Wide Field Imager (WFI), able to observe a range of 700 km  with 70 meters of spatial resolution. Its rapid revisit feature  will enable Amazon deforestation alert data to improve in real  time by maximizing the acquisition of useful images in the face of  cloud cover in the region. The Amazonia-1 will also provide  frequent images of Brazilian areas, and may be useful in other  environmental monitoring applications, such as the coastal zone,  water reservoirs, forests of other biomes and natural disasters.  The Amazonia-1 satellite is based on the Multi-Mission Platform  (MMP), which was also developed by INPE and other Brazilian  industries as a part of the National Program of Space Activities  (PNAE), coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). The MMP  is generic platform to 500 kg class satellites. With 250 kg mass,  it provides the necessary resources, in terms of power, control,  communication and others to operate, in orbit, a payload of up to  280 kg. The requirement of high rate of revisits and the need of  controlling and data reception of other remote sensing satellites  available in Brazil, for example, the CBERS (26 days to revisit)  impose new challenges for the ground segment, related to control  system of orbit and attitude and consequently in the reception,  processing and distribution of data through the ground segment  using the Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol Services. The SLE  protocol services establish activities, based on the Consultative  Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for cross support  recommendations, including Management Services for Data Transfer  and SLE protocol services related to Telemetry and Telecommand.  These services standards have been adopted by the different space  agencies, such as: ESA, NASA, CNES, DLR, ASI, JAXA, INPE, to  performing tracking and controlling of the spacecrafts. This paper  presents an overview of the Amazonia-1 satellites ground segment,  its objectives, the satellite design based in the Multi-Mission  Platform (MMP) and also the preparation of the ground segment for  the operation with the SLE Protocol and allow for efficient  operations with cross support.},

This data is received continually during the entire mission life of the Satellite. Hence a huge volume of Data is collected for any given satellite. Data Mining techniques are now regularly applied to analyse such large quantity of data for outlier analysis, fault detection in past data and fault prediction. In the present work, hidden relationships between apparently unrelated Telemetry parameters are mined by applying Rule Induction and Association Rule mining algorithms separately on a data set with randomly selected parameters. From the results obtained, a comparison is made to assess the suitability of either of these techniques to the application domain. This paper presents a finding that Rule Mining Algorithm is most appropriate for the domain application since Association rule mining is not amenable to data sets of Satellite Telemetry Parameters which are highly unrelated but whose functional inter-relationships during specified on-orbit stages are to be mined.},

  abstract = {With hyperspectral pushbroom imaging spectrometers on Earth observation satellites it is possible to detect and identify dedicated ground pixels by their spectral signature. Conventional time consuming on-ground processing performs this selection by processing the measured hyperspectral data cube of the image. The Imaging Spectral Signature Instrument (ISSI) concept combines an optical on-board processing of the hyperspectral data cube with a thresholding algorithm, to identify pixels with a pre-defined and programmable spectral signature, such as water, forest and minerals, in the ground swath. The Imaging Spectral Signature Instrument consists of an imaging telescope, which images an object line on the entrance slit of a first imaging spectrometer, which disperses each pixel of the object line into its spectral content and images the hyperspectral image on the spatial light modulator. This spatial light modulator will be programmed with a spatial transmission or reflection behavior, which is constant along the spatial pixels and along the spectral pixels identical to a filter vector that corresponds to the spectral signature of the searched specific feature. A second inverted spectrometer reimages the by the first spectrometer dispersed and by the spatial light modulator transmitted or reflected flux into a line of pixels. In case the spectral content of the ground scene is identical to the searched signature, the flux traversing or reflecting the spatial light modulator will be maximum. The related pixel can be identified in the final image as a high signal by a threshold discriminator. A component test setup consists of an imaging lens, two Imspector\texttrademark{} spectrographs, a spatial light modulator, which is a programmable transmissible liquid crystal display and a CCD sensor as a detector. A mathematical model was developed for the instrument and its performance was evaluated in order to compare different concept variations. All components were measured and characterized individually, and the results were used in the simulations. Performance was then analyzed by means of radiometric throughput and spatial and spectral resolutions. The simulations were performed at wavelengths of 450 nm to 900 nm. The throughput was found to be between 1\% and 4.5\%.},

  abstract = {Quantum machine learning is one of the most promising applications of a full-scale quantum computer. Over the past few years, many quantum machine learning algorithms have been proposed that can potentially offer considerable speedups over the corresponding classical algorithms. In this paper, we introduce q-means, a new quantum algorithm for clustering which is a canonical problem in unsupervised machine learning. The \$q\$-means algorithm has convergence and precision guarantees similar to \$k\$-means, and it outputs with high probability a good approximation of the \$k\$ cluster centroids like the classical algorithm. Given a dataset of \$N\$ \$d\$-dimensional vectors \$v\_i\$ (seen as a matrix \$V \textbackslash in \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\^\{N \textbackslash times d\})\$ stored in QRAM, the running time of q-means is \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}\textbackslash left( k d \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash eta\}\{\textbackslash delta\^2\}\textbackslash kappa(V)(\textbackslash mu(V) + k \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash eta\}\{\textbackslash delta\}) + k\^2 \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash eta\^\{1.5\}\}\{\textbackslash delta\^2\} \textbackslash kappa(V)\textbackslash mu(V) \textbackslash right)\$ per iteration, where \$\textbackslash kappa(V)\$ is the condition number, \$\textbackslash mu(V)\$ is a parameter that appears in quantum linear algebra procedures and \$\textbackslash eta = \textbackslash max\_\{i\} ||v\_\{i\}||\^\{2\}\$. For a natural notion of well-clusterable datasets, the running time becomes \$\textbackslash widetilde\{O\}\textbackslash left( k\^2 d \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash eta\^\{2.5\}\}\{\textbackslash delta\^3\} + k\^\{2.5\} \textbackslash frac\{\textbackslash eta\^2\}\{\textbackslash delta\^3\} \textbackslash right)\$ per iteration, which is linear in the number of features \$d\$, and polynomial in the rank \$k\$, the maximum square norm \$\textbackslash eta\$ and the error parameter \$\textbackslash delta\$. Both running times are only polylogarithmic in the number of datapoints \$N\$. Our algorithm provides substantial savings compared to the classical \$k\$-means algorithm that runs in time \$O(kdN)\$ per iteration, particularly for the case of large datasets.},

  abstract = {Introduction : The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of privacy-preserving data cubes of electronic medical records (EMRs). An EMR data cube is a complex of EMR statistics that are summarized or aggregated by all possible combinations of attributes. Data cubes are widely utilized for efficient big data analysis and also have great potential for EMR analysis. For safe data analysis without privacy breaches, we must consider the privacy preservation characteristics of the EMR data cube. In this paper, we introduce a design for a privacy-preserving EMR data cube and the anonymization methods needed to achieve data privacy. We further focus on changes in efficiency and effectiveness that are caused by the anonymization process for privacy preservation. Thus, we experimentally evaluate various types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes using several practical metrics and discuss the applicability of each anonymization method with consideration for the EMR analysis environment. Methods : We construct privacy-preserving EMR data cubes from anonymized EMR datasets. A real EMR dataset and demographic dataset are used for the evaluation. There are a large number of anonymization methods to preserve EMR privacy, and the methods are classified into three categories (i.e., global generalization, local generalization, and bucketization) by anonymization rules. According to this classification, three types of privacy-preserving EMR data cubes were constructed for the evaluation. We perform a comparative analysis by measuring the data size, cell overlap, and information loss of the EMR data cubes. Results : Global generalization considerably reduced the size of the EMR data cube and did not cause the data cube cells to overlap, but incurred a large amount of information loss. Local generalization maintained the data size and generated only moderate information loss, but there were cell overlaps that could decrease the search performance. Bucketization did not cause cells to overlap and generated little information loss; however, the method considerably inflated the size of the EMR data cubes. Conclusions : The utility of anonymized EMR data cubes varies widely according to the anonymization method, and the applicability of the anonymization method depends on the features of the EMR analysis environment. The findings help to adopt the optimal anonymization method considering the EMR analysis environment and goal of the EMR analysis.},

Deploying a space device, e.g. a satellite, is becoming more accessible to small actors due to the development of modular satellites and commercial space launches, which fuels further growth of this area. Deep learning's ability to deliver sophisticated computational intelligence makes it an attractive option to facilitate various tasks on space devices and reduce operational costs. In this work, we identify deep learning in space as one of development directions for mobile and embedded machine learning. We collate various applications of machine learning to space data, such as satellite imaging, and describe how on-device deep learning can meaningfully improve the operation of a spacecraft, such as by reducing communication costs or facilitating navigation. We detail and contextualise compute platform of satellites and draw parallels with embedded systems and current research in deep learning for resource-constrained environments.},

  abstract = {Sentinel-1A is a 2-ton spacecraft of the Copernicus Earth observation program operated by ESA's Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Sentinel-1A and its sister spacecraft Sentinel-1B operate in a sun-synchronous orbit at about 700~km altitude. On 2016/08/23 17:07:37 UTC, Sentinel-1A suffered from an anomaly resulting in a sudden permanent partial power loss and significant impulsive orbit and attitude changes. A deeper investigation identified that an impulsive orbit change against flight direction of 0.7~mm/s, estimated at the time of the event, gave the best results in terms of GPS residuals. At the same time, a peak attitude off-pointing of 0.7\textdegree{} (around the spacecraft yaw axis) and peak attitude rate increase of 0.04\textdegree/s (around the same axis) were observed. The simultaneous occurrence of these anomalies, starting from a sudden attitude change and ending with a permanent partial power loss, made an MMOD (Micro-Meteoroid and Orbital Debris) impact onto a solar array a possible explanation for this event. While the spacecraft is able to continue its mission nominally, a detailed investigation involving ESA's Space Debris and Flight Dynamics experts was conducted. An MMOD impact as an explanation gained further credibility, due to the pictures of the solar array taken by the on-board camera displaying a significant damage area. On September 7th, JSpOC (US Joint Space Operations Centre) informed SDO on 8 tracked fragments that are considered to be released by Sentinel-1A after the impact. This paper addresses the analysis that was performed on the data characterising the attitude and orbit change, the on-board camera image, and the tracked fragments. The data helped to identify the linear momentum vector while a flux analysis helped to identify the origin of the impactor and allowed to understand its mass and size characteristics.},

A new planning modeling language was created, which allows a description of the operations domain closer to the real system and with few abstractions. The implemented architecture is integrated to the flight software and fit to run in space-qualified hardware with limited processing power.},

The diffraction of the directed energy system plays an important role and limits the maximum speed of the spacecraft. We consider 'photon recycling' as a possible method to achieving higher speeds.

Differential drag is caused when the ballistic coefficients of the spacecraft in a formation are not equal. The magnitude of differential drag depends on the difference in ballistic coefficients and also the altitude of the spacecraft formation. AGI's Satellite Tool Kit is used initially to assess the magnitude of drifts caused due to differential drag for different altitudes. This information is then used to show that it is feasible to use differential drag for spacecraft formation control. A simple PID controller is then implemented that adjusts the cross sectional areas of the satellites such that the energies of the orbits remain equal. Results are presented that show that the control law can maintain the formation separation with reasonable accuracy.},

Data Cube is introduced which is a way of structuring data in N-dimensions so as to perform analysis over some measure of interest. Data cube computation is essential task in data warehouse implementation. The precomputation of all or part of a data cube can greatly reduce the response time and enhance the performance of on-line analytical processing. There are several methods for cube computation, several strategies to cube materialization and some specific computation algorithms, namely Multiway array aggregation, BUC, Star Cubing, the computation of shell fragments and parallel algorithms. But these techniques have limitation so new MapReduce based approach is used.},

While current literature mainly focuses on fairness for Bitcoin-like blockchains, little has been done to analyze Tendermint. Tendermint is a blockchain technology that uses a committee-based consensus algorithm, which finds an agreement among a set of block creators (called validators), even if some are malicious. Validators are regularly selected to the committee based on their investments. When a validator does not have enough asset to invest, it can increase it with the help of participants that delegate their assets to the validators (called delegators). In this paper, we implement the default Tendermint model and a Tendermint model for fairness in a multi-agent blockchain simulator where participants are modeled as rational agents who enter or leave the system based on their utility values. We conducted experiments for both models where agents have different investment strategies and with various numbers of delegators. In the light of our experimental evaluation, we observed that while, for both models, the fairness decreases and the system shrinks in the absence of delegators, the fairness increases, and the system expands for the second model in the presence of delegators.},

E.g., if we find that average boots sales in the West 10th store of Walmart was the same for winter as for the whole year, it signifies something interesting about the trend of boots sales in that location in that year. In this paper, we are interested in finding succinct summaries of the data cube, exploiting regularities present in the cube, with a clear basis. We would like the summary: (i) to be as concise as possible, (ii) to itself form a lattice preserving the rollup/drilldown semantics of the cube, and (iii) to allow the original cube to be fully recovered. We illustrate the utility of solving this problem and discuss the inherent challenges. We develop techniques for partitioning cube cells for obtaining succinct summaries, and introduce the quotient cube. We give efficient algorithms for computing it from a base table. For monotone aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, MIN, MAX, SUM on non-negative measures, etc.), our solution is optimal (i.e., quotient cube of the least size). For nonmonotone functions (e.g., AVG), we obtain a locally optimal solution. We experimentally demonstrate the efficacy of our ideas and techniques and the scalability of our algorithms.},

  abstract = {Quantum machine learning has emerged as an exciting and promising paradigm inside quantum technologies. It may permit, on the one hand, to carry out more efficient machine learning calculations by means of quantum devices, while, on the other hand, to employ machine learning techniques to better control quantum systems. Inside quantum machine learning, quantum reinforcement learning aims at developing "intelligent" quantum agents that may interact with the outer world and adapt to it, with the strategy of achieving some final goal. Another paradigm inside quantum machine learning is that of quantum autoencoders, which may allow one for employing fewer resources in a quantum device via a training process. Moreover, the field of quantum biomimetics aims at establishing analogies between biological and quantum systems, to look for previously inadvertent connections that may enable useful applications. Two recent examples are the concepts of quantum artificial life, as well as of quantum memristors. In this Perspective, we give an overview of these topics, describing the related research carried out by the scientific community.},

  abstract = {The security of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) algorithms deployed in real life applications are of a primary concern. In particular, the robustness of RL agents in cyber-physical systems against adversarial attacks are especially vital since the cost of a malevolent intrusions can be extremely high. Studies have shown Deep Neural Networks (DNN), which forms the core decision-making unit in most modern RL algorithms, are easily subjected to adversarial attacks. Hence, it is imperative that RL agents deployed in real-life applications have the capability to detect and mitigate adversarial attacks in an online fashion. An example of such a framework is the Meta-Learned Advantage Hierarchy (MLAH) agent that utilizes a meta-learning framework to learn policies robustly online. Since the mechanism of this framework are still not fully explored, we conducted multiple experiments to better understand the framework's capabilities and limitations. Our results shows that the MLAH agent exhibits interesting coping behaviours when subjected to different adversarial attacks to maintain a nominal reward. Additionally, the framework exhibits a hierarchical coping capability, based on the adaptability of the Master policy and subpolicies themselves. From empirical results, we also observed that as the interval of adversarial attacks increase, the MLAH agent can maintain a higher distribution of rewards, though at the cost of higher instabilities.},

Computing a data cube requires a long sequence of basic operations and storage costs. Exponentially accumulating amounts of data have reached a magnitude that overwhelms the processing capacities of single computers. In this paper, we implement a large-scale data cube computation based on distributed parallel computing using the MapReduce (MR) computational framework. For this purpose, we developed a new algorithm, MRDataCube, which incorporates the MR mechanism into data cube computations such that effective data cube computations are enabled even when using the same computing resources. The proposed MRDataCube consists of two-level MR phases, namely, MRSpread and MRAssemble. The main feature of this algorithm is a continuous data reduction through the combination of partial cuboids and partial cells that are emitted when the computation undergoes these two phases. From the experimental results we revealed that MRDataCube outperforms all other algorithms.},

Encoding and, most importantly, decoding of these arrays consumes considerable CPU time. Therefore, substantial effort has been made to reduce costs associated with compression and decompression. In particular, researchers have exploited the superscalar nature of modern processors and SIMD instructions. Nevertheless, we introduce a novel vectorized scheme called SIMD-BP128 that improves over previously proposed vectorized approaches. It is nearly twice as fast as the previously fastest schemes on desktop processors (varint-G8IU and PFOR). At the same time, SIMD-BP128 saves up to 2 bits per integer. For even better compression, we propose another new vectorized scheme (SIMD-FastPFOR) that has a compression ratio within 10\% of a state-of-the-art scheme (Simple-8b) while being two times faster during decoding.},

We can use the SIMD instructions available in common processors to boost the speed of integer compression schemes. Our S4-BP128-D4 scheme uses as little as 0.7 CPU cycles per decoded integer while still providing state-of-the-art compression. However, if the subsequent processing of the integers is slow, the effort spent on optimizing decoding speed can be wasted. To show that it does not have to be so, we (1) vectorize and optimize the intersection of posting lists; (2) introduce the SIMD Galloping algorithm. We exploit the fact that one SIMD instruction can compare 4 pairs of integers at once. We experiment with two TREC text collections, GOV2 and ClueWeb09 (Category B), using logs from the TREC million-query track. We show that using only the SIMD instructions ubiquitous in all modern CPUs, our techniques for conjunctive queries can double the speed of a state-of-the-art approach.},

But they are also made possible by the availability of easier and more frequent launches and the capability to handle increased requirements in terms of scalable mission operations and ``big'' data analytics on the ground and onboard. With the increase in this type of missions and with the need to connect and interrelate all the data that will be generated by these various missions as well as with the data acquired from ground and airborne sensors, there is a need to define more accurately all the terms used in relation to DSMs. This article presents a terminology including various definitions that describe DSMs and related concepts, their organization, physical configuration, and functional configuration, as well as a taxonomy from which DSMs can be designed.},

  abstract = {The computation of a data cube is one of the most essential but challenging issues in data warehousing and OLAP. Partition based algorithm is one of the efficient methods to compute data cubes on high dimensionality, low cardinality, and moderate size datasets, which exist in real applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing. To deal with such high dimensional data cubes, we propose an efficient indexing technique consisting of a compressed bitmap index and two algorithms for cube constructing and querying. Experimental results show that our method saves at least 25\% on storage space and about 30\% on computation time compared with the Frag-Cubing algorithm.},

  abstract = {Vision-based navigation has become increasingly important in a variety of space applications for enhancing autonomy and dependability. Future missions, such as active debris removal for remediating the low Earth orbit environment, will rely on novel high-performance avionics to support advanced image processing algorithms with substantial workloads. However, when designing new avionics architectures, constraints relating to the use of electronics in space present great challenges, further exacerbated by the need for significantly faster processing compared to conventional space-grade central processing units. With the long-term goal of designing high-performance embedded computers for space, in this paper, an extended study and tradeoff analysis of a diverse set of computing platforms and architectures (i.e., central processing units, multicore digital signal processors, graphics processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays) are performed with radiation-hardened and commercial off-the-shelf technology. Overall, the study involves more than 30 devices and 10 benchmarks, which are selected after exploring the algorithms and specifications required for vision-based navigation. The present analysis combines literature survey and in-house development/testing to derive a sizable consistent picture of all possible solutions. Among others, the results show that certain 28~nm system-on-chip devices perform faster than space-grade and embedded central processing units by 1\textendash 3 orders of magnitude, while consuming less than 10~W. Field-programmable gate array platforms provide the highest performance per watt ratio.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the use of differential drag in the formationkeeping of spacecraft. In many future space missions one satellite will be required to fly in a specific position with respect to another satellite; this action is referred to as formationkeeping. In this study, differential drag is the difference in drag between the two satellites. Reasons to use differential drag as an actuator for formationkeeping include the avoidance of jet plume impingement effects on closely spaced satellites and possible fuel savings.},

  abstract = {The Australian Geoscience Data Cube (AGDC) aims to realise the full potential of Earth observation data holdings by addressing the Big Data challenges of volume, velocity, and variety that otherwise limit the usefulness of Earth observation data. There have been several iterations and AGDC version 2 is a major advance on previous work. The foundations and core components of the AGDC are: (1) data preparation, including geometric and radiometric corrections to Earth observation data to produce standardised surface reflectance measurements that support time-series analysis, and collection management systems which track the provenance of each Data Cube product and formalise re-processing decisions; (2) the software environment used to manage and interact with the data; and (3) the supporting high performance computing environment provided by the Australian National Computational Infrastructure (NCI). A growing number of examples demonstrate that our data cube approach allows analysts to extract rich new information from Earth observation time series, including through new methods that draw on the full spatial and temporal coverage of the Earth observation archives. To enable easy-uptake of the AGDC, and to facilitate future cooperative development, our code is developed under an open-source, Apache License, Version 2.0. This open-source approach is enabling other organisations, including the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites (CEOS), to explore the use of similar data cubes in developing countries.},

We sketch the basics about programming quantum computers, showing that quantum programs are typically hybrid consisting of a mixture of classical parts and quantum parts. With the advent of quantum computers in the cloud, the cloud is a fine environment for performing quantum programs. The tool chain available for creating and running such programs is sketched. As an exemplary problem we discuss efforts to implement quantum programs that are hardware independent. A use case from machine learning is outlined. Finally, a collaborative platform for solving problems with quantum computers that is currently under construction is presented.},

  abstract = {Limited telemetry bandwidth due to restricted radio frequency spectrum allocation is typically one of the most challenging problems when designing a telemetry system for space applications. To further complicate the problem, a large percentage of the allotted bandwidth is consumed by the over-head required by each packet to follow various standards and layer of protocols used in the telemetry system. This results in inefficiency in the actual telemetry data downlinked to the ground station. In the typical telemetry design, only one virtual channel is used per packet. As a result, in order to achieve the required packet size, filled data is inserted into the remaining bits. This Idle Packet consists of a set pattern of binary digits, and is considered part of the overhead, as its sole purpose is to fill the packet. In this work, a new scheme is proposed which takes advantage of the empty bits by starting the next virtual channel instead of inserting filled bits. This method will reduce the overall amount of overheard, in addition to allowing more data to be transmitted.},

  abstract = {We propose Bohr, a similarity aware geo-distributed data analytics system that minimizes query completion time. The key idea is to exploit similarity between data in different data centers (DCs), and transfer similar data from the bottleneck DC to other sites with more WAN bandwidth. Though these sites have more input data to process, these data are more similar and can be more efficiently aggregated by the combiner to reduce the intermediate data that needs to be shuffled across the WAN. Thus our similarity aware approach reduces the shuffle time and in turn the query completion time (QCT). We design Bohr based on OLAP data cubes to perform efficient similarity checking among datasets in different sites. We implement Bohr on Spark and deploy it across ten sites of AWS EC2. Our extensive evaluation using realistic query workloads shows that Bohr improves the QCT by up to 50\% and reduces the intermediate data by up to 6x compared to state-of-the-art solutions that also use OLAP cubes.},

These include limited instrument aperture, low communications bandwidth, and reduced attitude control. Software techniques can address these limitations to retain the capabilities of larger spacecraft, in a small form factor. These techniques move the first order science analysis, which is traditionally completed on the ground, onboard the spacecraft. This can minimize the amount of data volume required for first order decision making. We present a collection of techniques designed for mitigating limited pointing stability for target acquisition, onboard image calibration and decision making, in a low bandwidth environment. These technologies will fly on the Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEA Scout) interplanetary CubeSat mission in 2019 [1]. To support verification and validation, the flight software implementations of these algorithms have been run on New Horizons, Rosetta and terrestrially acquired data sets. These experiments validate the capability to detect the target, through noise and target location uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Data cube has been playing an essential role in fast OLAP (online analytical processing) in many multi-dimensional data warehouses. However, there exist data sets in applications like bioinformatics, statistics, and text processing that are characterized by high dimensionality, e.g., over 100 dimensions, and moderate size, e.g., around 106 tuples. No feasible data cube can be constructed with such data sets. In this paper we will address the problem of developing an efficient algorithm to perform OLAP on such data sets. Experience tells us that although data analysis tasks may involve a high dimensional space, most OLAP operations are performed only on a small number of dimensions at a time. Based on this observation, we propose a novel method that computes a thin layer of the data cube together with associated value-list indices. This layer, while being manageable in size, will be capable of supporting flexible and fast OLAP operations in the original high dimensional space. Through experiments we will show that the method has I/O costs that scale nicely with dimensionality. Furthermore, the costs are comparable to that of accessing an existing data cube when full materialization is possible.},

  abstract = {Accurate orbit prediction (OP) of space debris is vital in Space Situation Awareness (SSA) related tasks, like space collision warnings. However, due to the sparse and low precision observations, unknown geometrical and physical features of debris, and effects of incomplete force models, OP based on the orbital mechanics theory or physics-based OP of space debris suffers from rapid error growth over a long duration, limiting the period of validity of debris OP for precise space applications. Considering that the tracking arcs of a debris object over a single station often share a similar temporal and spatial distribution in the inertial space, the resultant OP errors possibly have a coherent relationship with the temporal and spatial distribution of tracking arcs. This paper proposes a machine learning (ML)-based approach to model the underlying pattern of debris OP errors from historical observations and apply it to modify the future physics-based OP results. The approach includes three steps: constructing a historical OP error set, training a ML model to fit the historical OP error set, and correcting the future physics-based OP with ML-predicted orbital errors. The ensemble learning algorithm of boosting tree (BT) is studied as the primary ML method for the error modeling and predicting process. Experiments with three low-Earth-orbit (LEO) objects, tracked by a single radar station, demonstrate that the trained ML models can capture more than 80\% of the underlying pattern of the historical OP errors. More importantly, the errors of physics-based OP over the future 7 days reduce from thousands of meters to hundreds or even tens of meters through the error correction with the learned error pattern, achieving at least 50\% accuracy improvement. Such dramatic OP improvements show the promising potential of ML for enhanced SSA capability.},

The spacecraft health and safety telemetry are generally time dependent and periodical. The machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, are used to capture the time dependent trend of the telemetry datasets characterized by their data patterns and noise level, which provides a direct insights into the health and safety status of telemetry datasets. As the time dependent trends are highly sensitive to changes above the noise level, the potential anomalies can be detected at much early stage, which leads to a more proactive flight operations and a more resilient system. The challenges for the machine-learning approach in the spacecraft ground system are to develop a systematic, accurate, adaptive and efficient data training strategy, and a representation to meet persistent requirement. The focus of this paper is to present a machine-learning approach for the time dependent trending of spacecraft datasets with arbitrary scales. The data training algorithms have been developed and implemented in neural networks, which are shown to generate highly accurate time dependent trend. The OSA tool, ASRC Intelligent Monitoring System (AIMS), is presented, which implements the machine-learning algorithm. The extensions of machine-learning algorithms in developing capabilities to improve the mission efficiency and enable more autonomous operations are discussed.},

Are certain attributes correlated spatially or temporally? Are there trends or outliers in the data? Answering these questions requires aggregation over arbitrary regions of the domain and attributes of the data. Many relational databases implement the well-known data cube aggregation operation, which in a sense precomputes every possible aggregate query over the database. Data cubes are sometimes assumed to take a prohibitively large amount of space, and to consequently require disk storage. In contrast, we show how to construct a data cube that fits in a modern laptop's main memory, even for billions of entries; we call this data structure a nanocube. We present algorithms to compute and query a nanocube, and show how it can be used to generate well-known visual encodings such as heatmaps, histograms, and parallel coordinate plots. When compared to exact visualizations created by scanning an entire dataset, nanocube plots have bounded screen error across a variety of scales, thanks to a hierarchical structure in space and time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on a variety of real-world datasets, and present memory, timing, and network bandwidth measurements. We find that the timings for the queries in our examples are dominated by network and user-interaction latencies.},

However, its query cost is so high that it cannot be used in most applications. This paper introduces the semi-closed cube to reduce the size of data cube and achieve almost the same query response time as the data cube does. Semi-closed cube is a generalization of condensed cube and quotient cube and is constructed from a quotient cube. When the query cost of quotient cube is higher than a given threshold, semi-closed cube selects some views and picks a fellow for each of them. All the tuples of those views are materialized except those closed by their fellows. To find a tuple of those views, users only need to scan the view and its fellow. Thus, their query performance is improved. Experiments were conducted using a real-world data set. The results show that semi-closed cube is an effective approach of data cube.},

These different types of data (not necessarily structured) contain rich information. Based on this, a satellite for machine learning is proposed. First, a correlation analysis model is established, and a machine learning method is applied to the data prediction analysis of the satellite communication network. The basic idea and application process of the AdaBoost-BP algorithm are introduced in detail. Second, combined with the data features after dimensionality reduction processing, an efficient big data analysis model is trained. Third, in order to quickly locate the abnormal behavior of users under large-scale data, an algorithm for quantifying abnormal behaviors of users based on satellite communication network log information and quickly detecting and analyzing big data is proposed. Finally, experimental verification is performed. The experimental results verify that the method can improve the big data analysis capability of satellite communication networks.},

Especially, effective anomaly detection, based on telemetry data, plays an important role for the system health management of a spacecraft. With the advantages of easy-to-use, high efficiency, and data-driven, the predicted model has been applied for anomalous point detection for monitoring data. However, compared with the point abnormal mode, fragment anomaly is more attractive and meaningful for the system identification. Therefore, the detection strategy of fragment anomaly is proposed based on the uncertainty estimation of least square support vector machine and statistical analysis. Moreover, some effective estimation indicators are presented to evaluate the performance of the detection method. Experimental validations are also carried out for some typical simulation data sets and open source data sets. In particular, relied on the analysis of fragment anomaly modes, experiments are conducted with the real satellite telemetry data and different anomaly modes are injected to examine the applicability of the proposed framework.},

Online monitoring of data streams has emerged as an important research undertaking. Estimating the frequency of the items on these streams is an important aggregation and summary technique for both stream mining and data management systems with a broad range of applications. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art progress on methods of identifying frequent items from data streams. It describes different kinds of models for frequent items mining task. For general models such as cash register and Turnstile, we classify existing algorithms into sampling-based, counting-based, and hashing-based categories. The processing techniques and data synopsis structure of each algorithm are described and compared by evaluation measures. Accordingly, as an extension of the general data stream model, four more specific models including time-sensitive model, distributed model, hierarchical and multi-dimensional model, and skewed data model are introduced. The characteristics and limitations of the algorithms of each model are presented, and open issues waiting for study and improvement are discussed.},

  abstract = {Frequent pattern mining is an essential theme in data mining. Existing algorithms usually use a bottom-up search strategy. However, for very high dimensional data, this strategy cannot fully utilize the minimum support constraint to prune the rowset search space. In this paper, we propose a new method called top-down mining together with a novel row enumeration tree to make full use of the pruning power of the minimum support constraint. Furthermore, to efficiently check if a rowset is closed, we develop a method called the trace-based method. Based on these methods, an algorithm called TD-Close is designed for mining a complete set of frequent closed patterns. To enhance its performance further, we improve it by using new pruning strategies and new data structures that lead to a new algorithm TTD-Close. Our performance study shows that the top-down strategy is effective in cutting down search space and saving memory space, while the trace-based method facilitates the closeness-checking. As a result, the algorithm TTD-Close outperforms the bottom-up search algorithms such as Carpenter and FPclose in most cases. It also runs faster than TD-Close.},

However, traditional online analytical processing (OLAP) systems and techniques were not designed for sequence data and they are incapable of supporting sequence data analysis. In this paper, we propose the concept of Sequence OLAP, or S-OLAP for short. The biggest distinction of S-OLAP from traditional OLAP is that a sequence can be characterized not only by the attributes' values of its constituting items, but also by the subsequence/substring patterns it possesses. This paper studies many aspects related to Sequence OLAP. The concepts of sequence cuboid and sequence data cube are introduced. A prototype S-OLAP system is built in order to validate the proposed concepts. The prototype is able to support "pattern-based" grouping and aggregation, which is currently not supported by any OLAP system. The implementation details of the prototype system as well as experimental results are presented.},

  abstract = {When probability reliability analysis engineering was adopted in 1960 by the U.S. government, it became required use by spacecraft and launch vehicle suppliers to quantify spacecraft and launch vehicle reliability in probabilistic terms. Due to its use, spacecraft and launch vehicle suppliers stopped looking for the cause of premature equipment failures that was plaguing the industry. The government procurement contracts did not financially penalize space vehicle suppliers when their equipment failed prematurely, but did financially penalize them for a late delivery, increasing the motivation for space vehicle suppliers to overlook and misdiagnose equipment behavior in the test data that slowed down testing and increased risk of earning a financial penalty for a late delivery. The risk of a premature failure is so high that NASA GSFC pays for NOAA's long-life weather satellites after they get to space and function properly for at least one year. Military satellites fail prematurely so often that in 2010, the Air Force Space and Missiles Systems Center fined an Air Force space vehicle supplier \$15M for the premature failure of the apogee engine of the AEHF-1 satellite. The private space companies that own satellites and earn income selling the satellite services anticipate the premature failure of either their launch vehicle or satellite and purchase space insurance policies that cost up to \$60M to pay for all the financial losses that occur when their satellites and launch vehicles fail prematurely. To minimize the public from learning about the frequency that space vehicle equipment purchased by NASA and the military, fails prematurely, the information is proprietary to the company that produced it. The government agency's that purchase space vehicle equipment that fails prematurely do not want it to be known publically either and so the financial losses due to the premature failure of NASA and military satellites to the taxpayer is difficult to ascertain but is- identified by some sources as ranging from \$4B to \$10B per year. To stop the premature failure of space vehicle equipment, spacecraft equipment usable life can be measured using the same equipment telemetry data generated and used to measure and confirm equipment performance. Predictive algorithms use equipment analog telemetry to identify non-repeatable transient behavior in equipment telemetry related to equipment end-of-life. This paper will explain the technology, tools necessary to identify the space vehicle equipment that will fail prematurely from parts will accelerated aging in the space and ground segment environment with the presence of noise from a variety of sources.},

It also serves as a crew escape vehicle at the ISS to increase astronaut safety The NASA integrated, vehicle health management (IVHM) program has been adopted by many segments of the aerospace industry. The IVHM is the tool to prevent catastrophic failures by identifying the equipment that will fail prematurely for replacement, thus preventing/eliminating surprise equipment failures from threatening both safety and mission success. Due to the extreme environments experienced by both the launch vehicle and its payload (s) during launch and while operating in space the space industry often rejects most advancements made in other aerospace industries in technology related to and improving reliability. Personnel on the ground responsible for launch vehicle and spacecraft receive limited technical information from an on-board telemetry system that generates routes engineering data, whose accuracy is suspect, available from spacecraft when both planned and unplanned events occur. Included in this paper are examples of spacecraft equipment failures that have been accurately predicted to occur or prevented from occurring. We provide many examples of equipment telemetry measurements used to measure spacecraft equipment usable life. The equipment with a measured usable will fail prematurely with certainty. The equipment that will fail prematurely should be replaced at the factory or if the spacecraft is in space, the failure can be managed to a positive conclusion. This paper summarizes the use of a prognostic and health management program including using predictive algorithms to measure equipment life and predict remaining usable life with certainty on the many NASA space missions as specified in the NASA IVHM technical plan published in 2009. The non-Markov reliability paradigm for measuring equipment usable life wa- specifically developed for preventing surprise catastrophic equipment failures. It is already in use on the Air Force F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The decision to use a PHM is in part, based on the results from our prognostic analysis we completed on the NASA GSFC Extreme Ultra Violet Explorer LEO space science satellite and the NASA Space Shuttle Challenger and Columbia accidents. Our results identified the information that was present but was ignored for a variety of reasons that would have prevented both Space Shuttle accidents if the information had been properly interpreted.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to present the lessons learned in 20 years of application of the SCE (Systems Concurrent Engineering) approach that evolved over the last 20 years being applied to the development of more than 200 complex system solutions. SCE is an approach to the integrated development of complex systems that applies the systems engineering process, simultaneously, to the product elements of a system solution as well as for the service elements of the system solution, recursively, at every layer of the system solution breakdown structure. The approach was born as the application of the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes to the simultaneous development of a product, its life cycle processes and their performing organizations, at every layer of the product breakdown structure. The continuous application of the approach up to 2010, showed the need to include a stakeholder analysis step, to acknowledge that the solution was comprised of product and organization elements (processes were, in fact, the functions of products and organizations), that a mission layer should be added at the top of the product breakdown structure and that the notion of circumstances should be added to the traditional notion of scenarios. With the increasing use of the approach for system of systems conception and development such as those involving multi-spacecraft solutions, the mission layer needed to be extended to include other life cycle processes (besides the operations processes) concept of service and system service architecture. This requires the development of a system solution breakdown structure that will guide the development of the overall solution. For multi-spacecraft solutions, for example, it is necessary to conceive and architect testing, launching and decommissioning services as early as operations. Also, going into more detail in the approach, modes can be derived from circumstances, interface states and internal states of the system and not only from circumstances, as initially established in the approach. These lessons to be presented were learned during the development of: 1) the Brazilian Strategic Program for Space Systems (PESE) and; 2) the TIM Project (Telematics International Mission), a satellite formation with contributions from many regions in the world.},

  title = {A Systems Engineering and Concurrent Engineering Framework for the Integrated Development of Complex Products},
  author = {Loureiro, Geilson},
  year = {1999},
  abstract = {The aims of this research are to investigate the development of complex products (e.g. cars, satellites, aeroplanes), to identify areas for improvement and to make a contribution to those areas. The premise is that the shortcomings of a component design focused concurrent engineering (CE) and of a product focused systems engineering (SE) can be addressed by seeking a 'total view framework' that encompasses both, CE and SE. A broader scope of product development becomes necessary for coping with the complexity of the current very dynamic manufacturing business environment. Initial work was to undertake a comprehensive literature review drawing out the perceived needs in general as well as the particular needs of the space and automotive industries. This was supplemented with periods spent in industry with a major automotive manufacturer. It was found that complex product manufacturing industry faces a very dynamic and highly competitive global marketplace. In such a dynamic environment, the ongoing success of a development organisation is translated by its capacity to continuously shorten development cycle time, reduce cost, manage risks and, at the same time, improve product performance. The achievement of these objectives is highly dependent on the organisation's ability to cope with changes and with the complexity that may result from them. This involves identifying the elements that are likely to change and the interactions among them very early in the product development life cycle, in its conceptual stage. These elements are not only part of the product itself but are also part of the product life cycle processes and their performing organisations. Traditional development approaches provide only a partial picture of these elements and their interactions. For example, the traditional automotive approach fails to capture the interactions among the product elements. It uses a component approach that treats the product as a set of isolated components rather then as an integrated system. CE tools treat life cycle process elements in isolation of each other. Traditional satellite SE approach develops the product as a system but does not consider its life cycle processes as part of the system. In order to cope with product inherent complexity and with the complexity that may arise from changes, it is necessary to adopt an integrated development approach for complex product development.....},

  abstract = {Current attention on interstellar probes for near-term exploration of nearby star systems is focused on low-mass probes that can be accelerated to relativistic speed using propulsion from a ground-based DE beam. We consider the design of an optical communication downlink for the return of scientific data from such a probe at the distance of Proxima Centauri. The conditions under which background radiation can be neglected are quantified, and the design operates within that regime. Direct-detection is preferable to heterodyne, and in that context the transmitter should attain high peak-to-average transmitted power ratios. Based on available electric power sources, the downlink is expected to operate for years or even decades following target encounter, combined with low data rates. There are several areas in which technology innovations are needed, most of them related to Earth-based large-area aperture receiver design with direct detection. A major issue is the choice of multiplexing approach to support multiple probe downlinks and related challenges. Due to the interaction of trajectory parallax effects with field-of-view, we conclude that aperture synthesis with controlled optical beam forming may be required to reject radiation from the target star. Short visible wavelengths for laser communications are also highly advantageous in reducing that radiation. Highly selective optical bandpass filtering is needed to reject unnecessary background radiation, and a short-term data uplink is required to configure the transmit wavelength for variations in probe speed. Fundamental limits on the photon efficiency are compared to a concrete modulation/coding design in the presence of weather-based outages.},

  abstract = {In the nearly 60 years of spaceflight we have accomplished wonderful feats of exploration that have shown the incredible spirit of the human drive to explore and understand our universe. Yet in those 60 years we have barely left our solar system with the Voyager 1 spacecraft launched in 1977 finally leaving the solar system after 37 years of flight at a speed of 17 km/s or less than 0.006\% the speed of light. As remarkable as this is we will never reach even the nearest stars with our current propulsion technology in even 10 millennium. We have to radically rethink our strategy or give up our dreams of reaching the stars, or wait for technology that does not currently exist. While we all dream of human spaceflight to the stars in a way romanticized in books and movies, it is not within our power to do so, nor it is clear that this is the path we should choose. We posit a technological path forward, that while not simple, it is within our technological reach. We propose a roadmap to a program that will lead to sending relativistic probes to the nearest stars and will open up a vast array of possibilities of flight both within our solar system and far beyond. Spacecraft from gram level complete spacecraft on a wafer ("wafersats") that reach more than 1/4 c and reach the nearest star in 20 years to spacecraft with masses more than 10\^5 kg (100 tons) that can reach speeds of greater than 1000 km/s. These systems can be propelled to speeds currently unimaginable with existing propulsion technologies. To do so requires a fundamental change in our thinking of both propulsion and in many cases what a spacecraft is. In addition to larger spacecraft, some capable of transporting humans, we consider functional spacecraft on a wafer, including integrated optical communications, imaging systems, photon thrusters, power and sensors combined with directed energy propulsion.},

  abstract = {Mars Express (MEX) has been orbiting Mars, generating great science for over 13 years. The aging spacecraft faces challenges; eclipse seasons are getting longer, eclipse durations are increasing and battery degradation is worsening. Accurate power modelling, respecting the power budget, becomes more vital as this ensures MEX health and maximum science. Empirical thermal power models provide reliable long term predictions but lack sensitivity. Telemetry data accumulated during the mission is a rich information source from which to derive a new model. This paper shows how the MEX Flight Control Team released 3 Martian years of data and reached out to Machine Learning (ML) enthusiasts asking them to predict a fourth year of spacecraft telemetry. In return, the participants were invited to an open data day to meet the MEX operators, tour ESA and find out about many exciting missions, and present and share their solutions with other candidates and ESA staff members. But the reward of solving a complex challenge, in a novel environment for space application, lead an incredible response from the worldwide ML community. Using open source solutions, candidates built data-driven models which have been able to predict the power consumption of 33 thermal lines, every hour, over a full Martian year (687 Earth days). These models improve sensitivity and accuracy by an order of magnitude. The number of scientific observations may increase even during power constrained periods when incorporating such models into MEX mission planning. By releasing spacecraft data and engaging with ML communities, ESA has gained a novel means to better exploit spacecraftresources, increase scientific return, and so, prolong mission life.},

To  do so, we develop a model based on macroscopic principles which  can be generalized to a wide variety of topologies, power supply  and battery technologies. From the model obtained, we identify the  emergent property of thermal avalanche in the system which arises  when we consider the interactions between equipment. We show that  this avalanche effect is due to the interaction of battery  parameters such as efficiency or double-layer capacitance,  degradation of system parameters and the operational modes of the  system. Having identified the causes of thermal instability, we  develop a new metric, based on graphical methods, obtained from  the Poincar\'e map, enabling the establishment of a stability  margin, as well as the identification of the threshold for  triggering a thermal avalanche.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the success of deep learning in recent years, prediction-based methods are used to compress satellite telemetry data. In this paper, two-stage lossless compression methods for telemetry data are demonstrated. In the first stage, different approaches of long short-term memory (LSTM) based on one-to-one, many-to-one, and many-to-many network architectures are presented. The framework of implementing each approach, as a predictor, is discussed. In the second stage, a set of competing entropy coding methods are tested and evaluated. The presented approaches are capable of exploring correlation dependencies between consecutive samples in the individual and/or successive telemetry frames. The proposed approaches are introduced in two different versions: stacked- and nonstacked-based LSTM architectures trying to achieve higher prediction efficiency. The proposed approaches are tested on real telemetry data, in frames of different data word widths, in distinct FUNcube satellite sessions. The performance of each presented approach, as a predictor, is evaluated based on prediction gain, and reduction in entropy. However, the performance of the whole two-stage lossless compression method is assessed by compression ratio. Comparative analysis is preformed among the proposed approaches, and the improvements are verified against the state-of-the-art prediction-based approaches.},

Because of the curse of dimensionality, it is already known that well-known data structures like kd-tree, R-tree, and M-tree suffer in their performance over high-dimensional data space which is inferior to a brute-force approach linear scan. In this paper, we focus on an approximate nearest neighbor search for two different types of queries: r-Range search and k-NN search. Adapting a novel concept of a ring structure, we define a new index structure MLR-Index (Multi-Layer Ring-based Index) in a metric space and propose time and space efficient algorithms with high accuracy. Evaluations through comprehensive experiments comparing with the bestknown high-dimensional indexing method LSH show that our approach is faster for a similar accuracy, and shows higher accuracy for a similar response time than LSH.},

  abstract = {Space Settlements'' \textendash{} i.e., permanent human communities beyond Earth's biosphere \textendash{} have been discussed within the space advocacy community since the 1970s. Now, with the end of the International Space Station (ISS) program fast approaching (planned for 2024\textendash 2025) and the advent of low cost Earth-to-orbit (ETO) transportation in the near future, the concept is coming once more into mainstream. Considerable attention has been focused on various issues associated with the engineering and human health considerations of space settlement such as artificial gravity and radiation shielding. However, relatively little attention has been given to the biological implications of a self-sufficient space settlement. Three fundamental questions are explored in this paper: (1) what are the biological ``foundations'' of truly self-sufficient space settlements in the foreseeable future, (2) what is the minimum scale for such self-sustaining human settlements, and (3) what are the integrated biologically-driven system requirements for such settlements? The paper examines briefly the implications of the answers to these questions in relevant potential settings (including free space, the Moon and Mars). Finally, this paper suggests relevant directions for future research and development in order for such space settlements to become viable in the future.},

  abstract = {The growing numbers, complexity, and data return of space missions are driving a need for automated fault detection and diagnosis. Traditional fault monitoring techniques possess limited ability to diagnose anomalies, requiring operators to investigate extensive amounts of telemetry to isolate root causes. An important hurdle to automating fault diagnosis for complex subsystems such as attitude determination and control is that interpreting anomalies to determine a root cause is highly contextual and inherently uncertain. This paper presents a method of using one-class support vector machines to train a long short-term memory neural network to diagnose time-varying faults in a simulated CubeSat attitude determination and control subsystem. Using elements of transfer learning, the one-class support vector machines are retrained on nominal flight telemetry, allowing the neural network to diagnose faults on the flight unit. The diagnoses are robust to missing data, false positives, modeling errors, contradicting information, and multiple faults. An application is demonstrated for the LightSail 2 solar sail satellite, where the system succeeds in diagnosing both known and previously unknown attitude determination and control faults.},

Intensional query answering can help by providing a concise description of extensional answers (i.e., the sets of retrieved facts), generally relying on knowledge like integrity constraints, taxonomies, or patterns discovered from data. This paper proposes a framework for computing an intensional answer to an OLAP query by leveraging on the previous queries in the current session. Such intensional answer is concise and semantically rich, and allows the size of the extensional answers returned to be reduced, so as to achieve an effective trade-off between conciseness and informational content. After describing the general framework, we propose a specific instantiation that relies on previous contributions in cube modeling and intensional query answering.},

  abstract = {An adaptive system (AS) evaluates its own behavior and changes it when the evaluation indicates that the system is not accomplishing what it is intended to do, or when better functionality or performance is possible. MAPE-K is a reference model that prescribes the adaptation mechanism of ASs by means of high-level abstractions such as Monitors, Analyzers, Planners and Executors and the relationships among them. Since the abstractions and the relationships provided by MAPE-K are generic, other reference models were proposed focusing on providing lower level abstractions to support software engineers in a more suitable way. However, after the analysis of seven representative ASs, we realized the abstractions prescribed by the existing reference models are not properly implemented, thus leading to architectural drifts. Therefore, in this paper we characterized three of these drifts by describing them with a template and showing practical examples. The three architectural drifts of ASs are Scattered Reference Inputs, Mixed Executors and Effectors, and Obscure Alternatives. We expect that by identifying and characterizing these drifts, we can help software architects improve their design and, as a consequence, increase the reliability of this type of systems.},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of diverse multidimensional data on the web has led to the creation and adoption of common vocabularies and practices that facilitate sharing, aggregating and reusing data from remote origins. One prominent example in the Web of Data is the RDF Data Cube vocabulary, which has recently attracted great attention from the industrial, government and academic sectors as the de facto representational model for publishing open multidimensional data. As a result, different datasets share terms from common code lists and hierarchies, this way creating an implicit relatedness between independent sources. Identifying and analyzing relationships between disparate data sources is a major prerequisite for enabling traditional business analytics at the web scale. However, discovery of instance-level relationships between datasets becomes a computationally costly procedure, as typically all pairs of records must be compared. In this paper, we define three types of relationships between multidimensional observations, namely full containment, partial containment and complementarity, and we propose four methods for efficient and scalable computation of these relationships. We conduct an extensive experimental evaluation over both real and synthetic datasets, comparing with traditional query-based and inference-based alternatives, and we show how our methods provide efficient and scalable solutions.},

  abstract = {The Galileo programme is a European Union project which provides worldwide geolocation services. In the final configuration, Galileo will have a constellation of 24 operational satellites and 6 spares located on 3 orbital planes. The constellation at the time of writing has 18 satellites controlled by the routine Galileo Control Centre (GCC-D) in the Deutsche Luft- und Raumfahrtgesellschaft (DLR, Oberpfaffenhofen - Germany). The Launch and Early Orbit Phase (LEOP) of these 18 have been prepared and performed not by GCC but by a joint ESA/ESOC (Darmstadt - Germany) and CNES (Toulouse - France) Flight Control Team. This is known as the CNESOC Team. The CNESOC team has conducted two LEOPs of two IOV (In Orbit Validation) spacecraft each, five LEOPs of two FOC (Full Operations Capability) spacecraft each and, most recently, a single LEOP of four FOC spacecraft, launched together on an Ariane-5 rocket. After conducting five FOC LEOPs at an average interval of five months, the LEOP Flight Control team was experienced, and the tools and procedures were mature. So in many ways the 4-spacecraft LEOP was simply a more complex and strenuous version of the previous LEOPs. However, there were challenges (expected and unexpected) that were unique to the 4-spacecraft scenario. The team was enlarged to cope with the additional satellites, but nevertheless scheduling was more complicated than it had been for previous LEOPs. It was not straightforward to reconcile the planned operations with the available ground-station coverage, and the need to provide appropriate breaks to team members over the long (two-week) LEOP. The scheduling was further complicated by security requirements on the maximum period of non-visibility for any spacecraft, and the objective of maintaining a complete telemetry archive (including dumps from periods of non-visibility) The enlarged team consisted of four on-console shifts, each capable of conducting all planned operations (as opposed to two-and-a-half shifts for previous LEOPs). The simple matter of coordinating the activities of these shifts, and managing communication between them, proved to be less straightforward than had been expected. For the 4-spacecraft LEOP there were entirely new scenarios to rehearse in the simulations campaign, including the two shifts on-console for separation, and four spacecraft operated by a single shift. These simulations gave valuable experience in prioritisation in case of contingencies. Various unforeseen problems were detected and mitigated during the simulations campaign. This paper is about the challenges of the first Galileo Ariane-5 launch, highlighting the technical and the human hurdles related to LEOP operations preparation and execution with four spacecraft.},

We verified that the treatment procedure improves significantly the quality of the images of the data cubes, allowing a more detailed analysis. The images of the Br\$\textbackslash gamma\$ and H\$\_2 \textbackslash lambda 21218\$ emission lines from the treated data cube of the nuclear region of NGC 5643 reveal the existence of ionized and molecular-gas clouds around the nucleus, which cannot be seen clearly in the images from the non-treated data cube of this galaxy. The ionized-gas clouds represent the narrow-line region, in the form of a bicone. We observe a good correspondence between the positions of the ionized-gas clouds in the Br\$\textbackslash gamma\$ image and in an [O III] image, obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope, of the nuclear region of this galaxy convolved with an estimate of the point-spread function of the data cube of NGC 5643. The morphologies of the ionized and molecular gas seem to be compatible with the existence of a molecular torus/disc that collimates the active galactic nucleus (AGN) emission. The molecular gas may also flow along this torus/disc, feeding the AGN. This scenario is compatible with the unified model for AGNs.},

Several sampling and sketching algorithms have been proposed to accurately solve this problem. The goal of the literature has always been to estimate the number of distinct elements while using minimal resources. However, in some modern applications, the accuracy of the estimate is of primal importance, and businesses are willing to trade more resources for better accuracy. Throughout our experience with building a distinct count system at a major search engine, Ask.com, we reviewed the literature of approximating distinct counts, and compared most algorithms in the literature. We deduced that Linear Counting, one of the least used algorithms, has unique and impressive advantages when the accuracy of the distinct count is critical to the business. For other estimators to attain comparable accuracy, they need more space than Linear Counting. We have supported our analytical results through comprehensive experiments. The experimental results highly favor Linear Counting when the number of distinct elements is large and the error tolerance is low.},

The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals. Major changes to the HST ground system are planned to be in place for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called 'vision December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system re-engineering effort, a project called 'vision 2000 control center systems (CCS)', are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's lifetime. Development costs will be reduced by providing a modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial of f the shelf (COTS) products wherever possible. Operating costs will be reduced by eliminating redundant legacy systems and processes and by providing an integrated ground system geared toward autonomous operation. Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for all HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will include a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform- independent from an office environment using commercial standards. Latest internet technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives. This paper will provide a high level overview of the CCS system and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities. Samples of CCS user interface pages will be given. Vision 2000 is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way. It will allow the HST program to realize reduced operations costs for the Third Servicing Mission and beyond.},

A major CCS subsystem is the Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on modern Data Warehousing technology. In fact, the Data Warehouse (DW) as implemented in the CCS Ground System that operates and monitors the Hubble Space Telescope represents, the first use of a commercial Data Warehouse to manage engineering data. By the end of February 2002, the process of populating the Data Warehouse with HST historical telemetry data had been completed, providing access to HST engineering data for a period of over 12 years with a current data volume of 2.8 Terabytes. This paper describes hands-on experience from an end user perspective, using the CCS system capabilities, including the Data Warehouse as an HST engineering telemetry archive. The Engineering Team at the Space Telescope Science Institute is using HST telemetry extensively for monitoring the Scientific Instruments, in particular for {$\cdot$} Spacecraft anomaly resolutions {$\cdot$} Scientific Instrument trending {$\cdot$} Improvements of Instrument operational efficiency The overall idea is to maximize science output of the space observatory. Furthermore, the CCS provides a powerful feature to build, save, and recall real-time display pages customized to specific subsystems and operational scenarios. Engineering teams are using the real-time monitoring capabilities intensively during Servicing Missions and real time commanding to handle anomaly situations, while the Flight Operations Team (FOT) monitors the spacecraft around the clock.},

Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube-based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space-efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re-computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web-based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities. We demonstrate the utility of Noise Profiler through a set of case studies.},

With the ever-increasing amount of user-generated content found online, ``what's trending'' is now a commonplace phrase that tries to capture the zeitgeist of the world by ranking the most popular microblogging hashtags in a given region and time. However, before we can understand what these rankings tell us about the world, we need to be able to more easily create and explore them, given the significant scale of today's data. In this paper, we describe the computational challenges in building a real-time visual exploratory tool for finding top-ranked objects; build on the recent work involving in-memory and rank-aware data cubes to propose TopKube: a data structure that answers top-k queries up to one order of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art; demonstrate the usefulness of our methods using a set of real-world, publicly available datasets; and provide a new set of benchmarks for other researchers to validate their methods and compare to our own.},

  abstract = {Formal concept analysis (FCA) has been successfully used in several Computer Science fields such as databases, software engineering, and information retrieval, and in many domains like medicine, psychology, linguistics and ecology. In data warehouses, users exploit data hypercubes (i.e., multi-way tables) mainly through online analytical processing (OLAP) techniques to extract useful information from data for decision support purposes.Many topics have attracted researchers in the area of data warehousing: data warehouse design and multidimensional modeling, efficient cube materialization (pre-computation), physical data organization, query optimization and approximation, discovery-driven data exploration as well as cube compression and mining. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to apply or adapt data mining approaches and advanced statistical analysis techniques for extracting knowledge (e.g., outliers, clusters, rules, closed n-sets) from multidimensional data. Such approaches or techniques cover (but are not limited to) FCA, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, log-linear modeling, and non-negative multi-way array factorization. Since data cubes are generally large and highly dimensional, and since cells contain consolidated (e.g., mean value), multidimensional and temporal data, such facts lead to challenging research issues in mining data cubes. In this presentation, we will give an overview of related work and show how FCA theory (with possible extensions) can be used to extract valuable and actionable knowledge from data warehouses.},

We have entered in a crucial time where using Big Data can be the difference (for terrestrial applications) between organizations underperforming and outperforming their peers. The same is true for NASA and other space agencies, as well as for individual missions and the highly-competitive process of mission data analysis and publication. In most industries, conventional opponents and new candidates alike will influence data-driven approaches to revolutionize and capture the value of Big Data archives. The Open Space Box Model is poised to take the proverbial ``giant leap'', as it provides autonomic data processing and communications for spacecraft. We can find economic value generated from such use of data processing in our earthly organizations in every sector, such as healthcare, retail.

In general, PnP does not consider data uniformity, named skew, when partitioning its workload and, thus, it imposes a maximum data redundancy even with uniform data. Due to this scenario, we implement P2CDM (acronym of Parallel Cube Computation with Distributed Memory) approach which has minimized communication and low data redundancy. Globally, at the entire cluster, P2CDM automatically generates data redundancy only for skewed values among all dimensions of a Data Warehouse. Locally, at each host, P2CDM provides cube cells pruning using MCG approach. The result is a distributed approach that computes massive full or partial data cubes over a cluster of commodity PCs. The experiments demonstrated that both approaches have similar speedup, but P2CDM approach is 20-25\% faster and consumes 30-40\% less memory at each host of the cluster, when compared to PnP approach.},

  abstract = {Data cube construction has been the focus of much research due to its importance in improving efficiency of OLAP. A significant fraction of this work has been on ROLAP techniques, which are based on relational technology. Existing ROLAP cubing solutions mainly focus on "flat" datasets, which do not include hierarchies in their dimensions. Nevertheless, the nature of hierarchies introduces several complications into cube construction, making existing techniques essentially inapplicable in a significant number of real-world applications. In particular, hierarchies raise three main challenges: (a) The number of nodes in a cube lattice increases dramatically and its shape is more involved. These require new forms of lattice traversal for efficient execution. (b) The number of unique values in the higher levels of a dimension hierarchy may be very small; hence, partitioning data into fragments that fit in memory and include all entries of a particular value may often be impossible. This requires new partitioning schemes. (c) The number of tuples that need to be materialized in the final cube increases dramatically. This requires new storage schemes that remove all forms of redundancy for efficient space utilization. In this paper, we propose CURE, a novel ROLAP cubing method that addresses these issues and constructs complete data cubes over very large datasets with arbitrary hierarchies. CURE contributes a novel lattice traversal scheme, an optimized partitioning method, and a suite of relational storage schemes for all forms of redundancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CURE through experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets. Among the experimental results, we distinguish those that have made CURE the first ROLAP technique to complete the construction of the cube of the highest-density dataset in the APB-1 benchmark (12 GB). CURE was in fact quite efficient on this, showing great promise with respect to the potential of the technique overall.},

Some literature has been produced about autonomous controllers for robotics, demonstrating that they can face a variety of domains. However, we can observe that the experiments performed lack of a common scientific methodology. Generally, isolated case studies are presented, without providing enough details to enable other researchers to replicate or to compare their works with the previous results in the field. The aim of this work is to contribute defining and operationalizing a framework for plan-based controllers assessment. Such effort is supported on a set of generally applicable metrics to entail evaluation of different aspects of robotics controllers. Besides these metrics, we have used OGATE, a domain independent tool that automatically carries on with controller assessments. Then, following a well-defined methodology, we are able to generate reproducible benchmarks, providing objective evidences of the experiments performed. To test our framework, we have used two plan-based controllers on the same robotic problem and platform. Results show that we are able to extract relevant data, allowing comparison of different autonomous controllers.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this document is to create a data model and its serialization for expressing generic time series data. Already existing IVOA data models are reused as much as possible. The model is also made as generic as possible to be open to new extensions but at the same time closed for modifications. This enables maintaining interoperability throughout different versions of the data model. We define the necessary building blocks for metadata discovery, serialization of time series data and understanding it by clients. We present several categories of time series science cases with examples of implementation. We also take into account the most pressing topics for time series providers like tracking original images for every individual point of a light curve or time-derived axes like frequency for gravitational wave analysis. The main motivation for the creation of a new model is to provide a unified time series data publishing standard - not only for light curves but also more generic time series data, e.g., radial velocity curves, power spectra, hardness ratio, provenance linkage, etc. The flexibility is the most crucial part of our model - we are not dependent on any physical domain or frame models. While images or spectra are already stable and standardized products, the time series related domains are still not completely evolved and new ones will likely emerge in near future. That is why we need to keep models like Time Series Cube DM independent of any underlying physical models. In our opinion, this is the only correct and sustainable way for future development of IVOA standards.},

Past literature from academia and industry have proposed and evaluated many cost models for spacecraft as well as methods for quantifying risk. However, there have been few comprehensive studies quantifying the cost for multiple spacecraft, for small satellites and the cost risk for the operations phase of the project which needs to be budgeted for when designing and building efficient architectures. This paper identifies the three critical problems with the applicability of current cost and risk models to distributed small satellite missions and uses data-based modeling to suggest changes that can be made in some of them to improve applicability. Learning curve parameters to make multiple copies of the same unit, technological complexity based costing and COTS enabled small satellite costing have been studied and insights provided.},

Specifically, we identify an important subset of holistic measures and introduce MR-Cube, a MapReduce based framework for efficient cube computation on these measures.

The approach is based on an adaptation of rough set theory to multidimensional data, and offers cube exploration and mining facilities. The objective of this work is to integrate approximation mechanisms and associated operators into data cubes in order to produce views that can then be explored using OLAP or data mining techniques. The integration of data approximation capabilities with OLAP techniques offers additional facilities for cube exploration and analysis. The proposed approach allows the user to work either in a restricted mode using a cube lower approximation or in a relaxed mode using cube upper approximation. The former mode is useful when the query output is large, and hence allows the user to focus on a reduced set of fully matching tuples. The latter is useful when a query returns an empty or small answer set, and hence helps relax the query conditions so that a superset of the answer is returned.},

We model this evolution with a view to assessing the probability of an encounter that might have significant terrestrial effects, through atmospheric dusting or multiple impacts. Such an encounter may have contributed to the large animal extinctions and sudden climatic cooling of 12 900 yr ago, and the near-simultaneous collapse of civilisations around 2350 BC.},

  abstract = {The potential for space mission operations and the supporting ground infrastructure is growing dramatically, fueled by new technologies, but with that growth comes increased complexity, and daunting reliability and security challenges. And like most complex endeavors, space operations are being asked to do more with less. In order to deliver cost-effective space operations services, researchers must explore novel ways to build and operate systems under study. Innovation is the engine that drives progress in today's high-tech global economy. Statistical multivariate latent techniques are one of the vital learning tools that are used to tackle the aforementioned problem coherently. There has been a tremendous increase in the volume of telemetry data over the last decade from contemporary spacecrafts. All these datasets need to be analyzed for finding interesting patterns or for searching for both moderate and significant outliers. Information extraction from such rich data sources using advanced statistical methodologies is a challenging task due to the massive volume of data. To solve this problem, in this paper, we present a novel supervised learning algorithm based on projection to latent structure discriminant analysis technique (PLS-DA). The algorithm is particularly uses to model, analyze, classify telemetry data and identify key contributors to anomalous events while simultaneously measuring several predictors and response variables. The performance of the algorithm using the telemetry acquired from of attitude determination and control system (ADCS) of actual remote sensing spacecraft was presented. In addition, a critical compression between the analysis results obtained by the algorithm and the multivariate statistical analysis software Simca-P developed by Umetrics was presented. Finally, the algorithm provides competent information in modelling, classifying, diagnosis and prediction as well as adding more insight and physical interpretation to the ADCS s- ate of health (SOH).},

This article discusses a new real application of a well-known data driven statistical software known as soft independent modeling for class analogy (SIMCA-P) developed by Umetrics to historical telemetry for attitude determination and control system (ADCS) of actual remote sensing spacecraft. Our design work is to detect anomalies from mission control center (MCC) through analyzing the telemetry readings received by MCC and respond to ADCS off-nominal situations by sending corrective actions tele-commands within real time to avoid critical and risky situations. We have implemented our approach on the engineering model of Egyptian satellite project Egypt-Sat1 and this model was our vehicle to simulate and verify the results. In conclusion, the analysis results provide a deep insight information and physical interpretation about the ADCS performance behavior.},

  abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) is a method for establishing secure cryptographic keys between two parties who share an optical, ``quantum'' channel and an authenticated classical channel. To share such keys across the globe, space-based links are required and in the near term these will take the form of trusted node, key management satellites. We consider such channels between two nanosatellite spacecraft for polarization entanglement-based QKD, and the optical channel is described in detail. Quantum channels between satellites are useful for balancing keys within constellations of trusted node QKD satellites and, in the future, may have applications in long-distance qubit exchange between quantum computers and in fundamental physics experiments. The nanosatellite mission proposed uses an optical link with 80-mm diameter optical terminals. If such a link could be maintained with 10-{$\mu$}rad pointing accuracy, then this would allow QKD to be performed for satellite separations up to around 400 km. A potential pointing and tracking system is also described although currently this design would likely limit the satellite separation to 100 to 150 km.},

  abstract = {This paper contains a factual update to the concept and operation of the performance data analysis and reporting system (PDARS) paper originally presented at the SAE conference, Montreal Canada, 2003 by den Braven and Schade. Since 1999 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has been operating a system for the collection, analysis, and reporting of performance-related data from the National Airspace System (NAS). This performance data analysis and reporting system (PDARS) has been installed at twenty Air Route Traffic Control Centers (ARTCCs), nineteen Terminal Radar Approach Control facilities (TRACONs), three service area offices, the FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center in Herndon, Virginia and FAA Headquarters offices in Washington, DC. The system generates and distributes close to 1000 reports daily for these facilities. PDARS calculates a range of performance measures, including traffic counts, travel times, travel distances, traffic flows, and in-trail separations. It turns these measurement data into information useful to FAA facilities through a\textsuperscript{2}n architecture that features (1) automatic collection and analysis of radar tracks and flight plans, (2) automatic generation and distribution of daily morning reports, (3) sharing of data and reports among facilities, and (4) support for exploratory and causal analysis. PDARS applications at FAA facilities include performance measurement, route and airspace design, noise abatement analysis, traffic flow management initiative assessment and design, training, and support for search and rescue. PDARS has also been used in a range of FAA and NASA studies. Examples are the measurement of actual benefits of the Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex airspace, an analysis of the Los Angeles Arrival Enhancement Procedure (AEP), an analysis of the Phoenix Dryheat departure procedure, measurement of navigation accuracy of aircraft using area navigation (RNAV) en route, a study on the detection and analysis of in-close approach changes, an evaluation of the benefits of domestic reduced vertical separation minimum implementation, and a baseline study for the airspace flow program.},

The formal representation of the meaning of business terms facilitates the unambiguous interpretation of query results as well as the sharing of knowledge among business analysts. In contrast to traditional ontologies, an MDO captures the multi-dimensional, hierarchical world view of business analysts. In this paper, we introduce a translation of MDO concepts to SQL in order to allow for the querying of a closed-world OLAP cube. We introduce a representation in OWL in order to determine subsumption hierarchies of MDO concepts using off-the-shelf reasoners.},

  abstract = {Mining association rules plays an important role in decision support systems. To mine strong association rules, it is necessary to mine frequent patterns. There are many algorithms that have been developed to efficiently mine frequent patterns, such as Apriori, Eclat, FP-Growth, PrePost, and FIN. However, these are only efficient with a small number of items in the database. When a database has a large number of items (from thousands to hundreds of thousands) but the number of transactions is small, these algorithms cannot run when the minimum support threshold is also small (because the search space is huge). This thus causes the problem of mining colossal patterns in high dimensional databases. In 2012, Sohrabi and Barforoush proposed the BVBUC algorithm for mining colossal patterns based on a bottom-up scheme. However, this needs more time to check subsets and supersets, because it generates a lot of candidates and consumes more memory to store these. In this paper we propose new, efficient algorithms for mining colossal patterns. Firstly, the CP (Colossal Pattern)-tree is designed. Next, we develop two theorems to rapidly compute patterns of nodes and prune nodes without the loss of information in colossal patterns. Based on the CP-tree and these theorems, an algorithm (named CP-Miner) is proposed to solve the problem of mining colossal patterns. A sorting strategy for efficiently mining colossal patterns is thus developed. This strategy helps to reduce the number of significant candidates and the time needed to check subsets and supersets. The PCP-Miner algorithm, which uses this strategy, is then proposed, and we also conduct experiments to show the efficiency of these algorithms.},

For example, on the task of detecting so-called Kepler objects of interest (KOIs), a range of different `off the shelf' classifiers has demonstrated outstanding performance. These rather preliminary research efforts motivate further exploration of this data domain. In the present work we focus on the analysis of threshold crossing events (TCEs) extracted from photometric data acquired by the Kepler spacecraft. We show that the task of classifying TCEs as being effected by actual planetary transits as opposed to confounding astrophysical phenomena is significantly more challenging than that of KOI detection, with different classifiers exhibiting vastly different performances. Nevertheless, the best performing classifier type, the random forest, achieved excellent accuracy, correctly predicting in approximately 96\% of the cases. Our results and analysis should illuminate further efforts into the development of more sophisticated, automatic techniques, and encourage additional work in the area.},

Titan is the only moon in the solar system to possess a dense atmosphere, which has important similarities to, and differences from, the Earth. Like Earth, Titan has lakes and seas on its surface [1] - although these are composed of liquid hydrocarbons and not water [2], [3]. The proposed mission concept is comprised of two elements: (1) A small satellite module (PCV, Probe Carrier Vehicle) that is deployed from a host Saturn system mission spacecraft, which can be a NASA small or medium class mission (either Discovery or New Frontiers mission class) and acts as a carrier and data relay for the entry probes; (2) Four atmospheric entry probes (EP), one per \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\textbackslash mathrmo\$ latitude from 60-90 \textdegree N, that aerobrake and descend under parachute from \$\textbackslash sim 135\$ km to the surface, measuring profiles of temperature, winds and gas composition during the descent. Multiple probes at different latitudes are required to constrain the spatial variation in cloud formation, precipitation and the implications for lake composition. The mission concept would require a ride-share to reach the Saturn system. Currently three of the seven anticipated New Frontiers mission destinations are in the Saturn System: Saturn Probe, Enceladus and Titan itself. The TEAM (Titan Exploration Atmospheric Microprobes) mission concept is designed to be largely independent once deployed in the Saturn system, however the prime mission spacecraft (either New Frontiers or Discovery class mission) will provide the data relay from the PCV to the Earth. Key mission challenges include thermal management and probe release and navigation.},

Inicialmente planejado para operar em orbita por cerca de um ano, o SCD-1 ja atinge a marca de tres anos de continua operacao e bons servicos de coleta de dados ambientais em todo territorio nacional. Esse resultado expressivo, que nao e comum na historia de outros paises que tambem chegaram ao espaco, e fruto da competencia desenvolvida no Pais no campo da engenharia espacial. Um bom projeto, testes exaustivos e controle em orbita cuidadoso transformaram o SCD-1 no maior sucesso da historia do INPE, orgulho de todos que, de alguma forma, contribuiram para isto. A confianca, adquirida com esse sucesso, abriu novos horizontes para o Programa Espacial Brasileiro, nas areas cientificas, tecnologicas e aplicadas. Varios novos objetivos, certamente mais ambidosos, foram tracados e alguns deles ja estarao se materializando no futuro proximo, com lancamentos de sateles mais complexos e voltados a outras necessidades do Pais.

In this paper we show that such a notation exists and can be useful in formalizing and reasoning about data aggregation operations. One such operation - the construction of a data cube - is shown to be easily expressible as a linear algebra operator. The construction is shown to be type-generic and some of its properties are derived from its typed definition and proved using matrix algebra. Other forms of data aggregation such as eg. rollup and cross tabulation are shown to be algebraically derivable from data cubes.},

  abstract = {Knowing the likelihood of collision for satellites operating in Geosynchronous Earth Orbit (GEO) is of extreme importance and interest to the global community and the operators of GEO spacecraft. Yet for all of its importance, a comprehensive assessment of GEO collision likelihood is difficult to do and has never been done. In this paper, we employ six independent and diverse assessment methods to estimate GEO collision likelihood. Taken in aggregate, this comprehensive assessment offer new insights into GEO collision likelihood that are within a factor of 3.5 of each other. These results are then compared to four collision and seven encounter rate estimates previously published. Collectively, these new findings indicate that collision likelihood in GEO is as much as four orders of magnitude higher than previously published by other researchers. Results indicate that a collision is likely to occur every 4 years for one satellite out of the entire GEO active satellite population against a 1 cm RSO catalogue, and every 50 years against a 20 cm RSO catalogue. Further, previous assertions that collision relative velocities are low (i.e., {$<$} 1 km/s) in GEO are disproven, with some GEO relative velocities as high as 4 km/s identified. These new findings indicate that unless operators successfully mitigate this collision risk, the GEO orbital arc is and will remain at high risk of collision, with the potential for serious follow-on collision threats from post-collision debris when a substantial GEO collision occurs.},

In fact, several organizations from different sectors depend increasingly on knowledge extracted from huge volumes of data. However, in Big Data context, traditional data techniques and platforms are less efficient. They show a slow responsiveness and lack of scalability, performance and accuracy. To face the complex Big Data challenges, much work has been carried out. As a result, various types of distributions and technologies have been developed. This paper is a review that survey recent technologies developed for Big Data. It aims to help to select and adopt the right combination of different Big Data technologies according to their technological needs and specific applications' requirements. It provides not only a global view of main Big Data technologies but also comparisons according to different system layers such as Data Storage Layer, Data Processing Layer, Data Querying Layer, Data Access Layer and Management Layer. It categorizes and discusses main technologies features, advantages, limits and usages.},

  abstract = {The Maunder minimum (MM) was a period of extremely low solar activity from approximately AD 1650 to 1715. In the solar physics literature, the MM is sometimes associated with a period of cooler global temperatures, referred to as the Little Ice Age (LIA), and thus taken as compelling evidence of a large, direct solar influence on climate. In this study, we bring together existing simulation and observational studies, particularly the most recent solar activity and paleoclimate reconstructions, to examine this relation. Using northern hemisphere surface air temperature reconstructions, the LIA can be most readily defined as an approximately 480 year period spanning AD 1440\textendash 1920, although not all of this period was notably cold. While the MM occurred within the much longer LIA period, the timing of the features are not suggestive of causation and should not, in isolation, be used as evidence of significant solar forcing of climate. Climate model simulations suggest multiple factors, particularly volcanic activity, were crucial for causing the cooler temperatures in the northern hemisphere during the LIA. A reduction in total solar irradiance likely contributed to the LIA at a level comparable to changing land use.},

Radar instruments are less affected by daylight or weather conditions than optical counterparts, suitable for continually monitoring the global biosphere. The current trends in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platform design are distinct from traditional approaches in that miniaturized satellites carrying SAR are launched in multiples to form a SAR constellation. A systems engineering perspective is presented in this paper to track the transitioning of space-based SAR platforms from large satellites to small satellites. Technological advances therein are analyzed in terms of subsystem components, standalone satellites, and satellite constellations. The availability of commercial satellite constellations, ground stations, and launch services together enable real-time SAR observations with unprecedented details, which will help reveal the global biomass and their changes owing to anthropogenic drivers. The possible roles of small satellites in global biospheric monitoring and the subsequent research areas are also discussed.},

In this paper, we describe the algorithms to build and query Hashedcubes, and how it can drive well-known interactive visualizations such as binned scatterplots, linked histograms and heatmaps. We report memory usage, build time and query latencies for a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, and find that although sometimes Hashedcubes offers slightly slower querying times to the state of the art, the typical query is answered fast enough to easily sustain a interaction. In datasets with hundreds of millions of elements, only about 2\% of the queries take longer than 40ms. Finally, we discuss the limitations of data structure, potential spacetime tradeoffs, and future research directions.},

This problem is typically solved by the method of alternating projections. To accelerate the convergence, the idea of using Quadratic Programming (QP) to project a point onto the intersection of halfspaces generated by the projection process was discussed in earlier papers. This paper looks at how one can integrate projection algorithms together with an active set QP algorithm. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show how to accelerate an SIP algorithm involving box constraints, and how to extend a version of the Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (ART) while preserving finite convergence. Lastly, the warmstart property of active set QP algorithms is a valuable property for the problem of projecting onto the intersection of convex sets.},

For autonomous or aided operations (e.g. automatic or aided landing), it is crucial to have on board an effective suite of sensors allowing navigation in unknown environments. This work performs obstacle detection and attitude estimation for a small quad-rotor by using low-cost sensors, namely, a Sonic Ranging Sensor (SRS) and an InfraRed Sensor (IRS), widely used in mobile applications for short distance measurements. Both sensors were controlled and managed by a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560) and synchronized at 2-Hz sampling. Attitude estimation was performed using multiple distance measurements between a solid surface (e.g. wall or ground) and the SRS/IRS sensors. A short range of 20-150 cm has been considered in order to assist the UAS landing procedure. The main objective was to integrate the SRS and IRS measurements for accurate distance and attitude estimation by means of variance minimization. Simulations and experimental results show the feasibility of low-cost sensor fusion for obstacle detection and ranging applications on a small rotary wing UAS.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) systems are increasingly deployed in safety- and security-critical domains including self-driving cars and malware detection, where the correctness and predictability of a system's behavior for corner case inputs are of great importance. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose erroneous behaviors for rare inputs. We design, implement, and evaluate DeepXplore, the first whitebox framework for systematically testing real-world DL systems. First, we introduce neuron coverage for systematically measuring the parts of a DL system exercised by test inputs. Next, we leverage multiple DL systems with similar functionality as cross-referencing oracles to avoid manual checking. Finally, we demonstrate how finding inputs for DL systems that both trigger many differential behaviors and achieve high neuron coverage can be represented as a joint optimization problem and solved efficiently using gradient-based search techniques. DeepXplore efficiently finds thousands of incorrect corner case behaviors (e.g., self-driving cars crashing into guard rails and malware masquerading as benign software) in state-of-the-art DL models with thousands of neurons trained on five popular datasets including ImageNet and Udacity self-driving challenge data. For all tested DL models, on average, DeepXplore generated one test input demonstrating incorrect behavior within one second while running only on a commodity laptop. We further show that the test inputs generated by DeepXplore can also be used to retrain the corresponding DL model to improve the model's accuracy by up to 3\%.},

This data needs to be analyzed to evaluate whether the satellite will be able to keep nominal operations in the future. Telemetry data is characterized by its high dimensionality, making analysis difficulty and hard to gener- alize for other satellites. This work aims to present a study on On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP) architecture alternative: the Data Cube. An overview of the Data Cube structure is presented, together with solutions that it might bring to satellite operations, and concludes by reviewing some alternatives in the literature.},

The package allows creation and updating of a data-cube of gridded daily data from 1900 onwards. Once created, point and area weighted estimates can be extracted at user-defined locations and time periods for anywhere within Australia. Examples of point and catchment average extraction are presented.},

In this paper, we investigate the effect of gyroless flight on the power consumption of MEX's thermal subsystems. In particular, we train predictive models from telemetry data obtained before the event on 16th April 2018 and estimate their performance on time periods before and after the event. This offers the chance to evaluate machine learning models on new situations (e.g., gyroless scenarios) while these models have been trained on scenarios that were yet unencountered. The results show that the predictive performance of the models estimated in the gyroless period is lower when compared to the estimated performance before the event. Notwithstanding, the estimated performance in both scenarios is very good and the differences are not practically significant. Hence, the models can be utilized for accurate prediction of the thermal power consumption in practical sense. Given MEX's new gyroless situation, which is likely to occur also on any other long lasting mission, we investigate the impact of the gyroscopes on the thermal power consumption and quantify the effects. Such modelling and analysis provides important insight into the spacecraft's new behavior, and still allows for planning optimization of MEX's operations, despite the radical change in the operational methodology.},

The PIU incorporates industry-standard digital interface(s) for both the payload and the Host Spacecraft and will be designed for standard spacecraft bus voltage. The PIU supports on-orbit operation in any Earth orbit, including Low Earth Orbit, Medium Earth Orbit, Highly Elliptical Orbit, and Geostationary Earth Orbit.

To support this instrument, a team at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) and other organizations composed of scientists, operations staff, and engineers has developed a set of tools to provide commanding, as well as assess its science data and engineering state of health. This paper focuses on a description of the tools used for JADE instrument commanding and assessing the instrument's state of health, how they are implemented, and the lessons learned along the way.

The core algorithmic idea is that of recursive partitioning the universe of representation: a markedly different paradigm than the widespread strategy of partitioning the sequence based on its length. Extensive experimentation and comparison against several competitive techniques shows that the proposed solution embodies an improved space/time trade-off for the set intersection problem.},

Our observations are supported by experiments using the document-level inverted index data for two large text collections, and a wide range of other index compression implementations as reference points. Those experiments demonstrate that the gap between efficiency and effectiveness can be substantially narrowed.},

Because of the many documents indexed by such engines and stringent performance requirements imposed by the heavy load of queries, the inverted index stores billions of integers that must be searched efficiently. In this scenario, index compression is essential because it leads to a better exploitation of the computer memory hierarchy for faster query processing and, at the same time, allows reducing the number of storage machines. The aim of this article is twofold: first, surveying the encoding algorithms suitable for inverted index compression and, second, characterizing the performance of the inverted index through experimentation.},

  abstract = {A realistic rendezvous and docking navigation solution applicable to CubeSats is investigated. The scalability analysis of the ESA Autonomous Transfer Vehicle Guidance, Navigation \& Control (GNC) performances and the Russian docking system, shows that the docking of two CubeSats would require a lateral control performance of the order of 1 cm. Line of sight constraints and multipath effects affecting Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements in close proximity prevent the use of this sensor for the final approach. This consideration and the high control accuracy requirement led to the use of vision sensors for the final 10 m of the rendezvous and docking sequence. A single monocular camera on the chaser satellite and various sets of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) on the target vehicle ensure the observability of the system throughout the approach trajectory. The simple and novel formulation of the measurement equations allows differentiating unambiguously rotations from translations between the target and chaser docking port and allows a navigation performance better than 1 mm at docking. Furthermore, the non-linear measurement equations can be solved in order to provide an analytic navigation solution. This solution can be used to monitor the navigation filter solution and ensure its stability, adding an extra layer of robustness for autonomous rendezvous and docking. The navigation filter initialization is addressed in detail. The proposed method is able to differentiate LEDs signals from Sun reflections as demonstrated by experimental data. The navigation filter uses a comprehensive linearised coupled rotation/translation dynamics, describing the chaser to target docking port motion. The handover, between GNSS and vision sensor measurements, is assessed. The performances of the navigation function along the approach trajectory is discussed.},

  abstract = {User Anomaly Detection, an important aspect of User Behaviour Analysis, is used to find anomalous user events from the event and network traffic log data. Traditional security mechanisms are not able to detect new/unknown types of anomalies as they do not incorporate contextual and behavioural aspects of the data for analysis. User Behaviour Anomaly Detection (UBAD) employs user behavioural patterns in context thereby achieving a higher detection rate. Log data employed for UBAD has multiple dimensions. With increase in dimensions (attributes), data gets sparse and the detection of anomalies becomes increasingly complex. For this reason, the single dimensional algorithms proposed for anomaly detection based on clustering, proximity and dimensional reduction do not work well on higher dimension data. OLAP based data analysis techniques provide efficient data slicing and aggregation operations crucial for multidimensional analytics along with multiscale visualisation for exploratory discovery. In this paper, an effective multidimensional process for UBAD is developed to detect anomalies using multi-dimensional statistical tests. An integral part of the process is the development of an OLAP Cube data model for event log data. The statistical efficiency of the UBAD process for different dimensions is investigated. On a real-life event log data, it is shown that the statistical efficiency of detection improves with the increased dimensionality of the tests: the true negative rate and the true positive rate show marked improvement. It is deduced that the computationally more expensive higher dimensional tests need to be employed in order to achieve better anomaly detection.},

Quantum computers with 50-100 qubits may be able to perform tasks which surpass the capabilities of today's classical digital computers, but noise in quantum gates will limit the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably. NISQ devices will be useful tools for exploring many-body quantum physics, and may have other useful applications, but the 100-qubit quantum computer will not change the world right away --- we should regard it as a significant step toward the more powerful quantum technologies of the future. Quantum technologists should continue to strive for more accurate quantum gates and, eventually, fully fault-tolerant quantum computing.},

This paper investigates leveraging deep learning and photorealistic rendering for monocular pose estimation of known uncooperative spacecrafts. We first present a simulator built on Unreal Engine 4, named URSO, to generate labeled images of spacecrafts orbiting the Earth, which can be used to train and evaluate neural networks. Secondly, we propose a deep learning framework for pose estimation based on orientation soft classification, which allows modelling orientation ambiguity as a mixture of Gaussians. This framework was evaluated both on URSO datasets and the ESA pose estimation challenge. In this competition, our best model achieved 3rd place on the synthetic test set and 2nd place on the real test set. Moreover, our results show the impact of several architectural and training aspects, and we demonstrate qualitatively how models learned on URSO datasets can perform on real images from space.},

Several social media own and publish huge and independently-built corpora of data about public places which are not linked each other. An aggregated view of information concerning the same public place could be extremely useful, but social media are not immutable sources, thus the off-line approach adopted in all previous research works cannot provide up-to-date information in real time. In this work, we address the problem of on-line aggregating geo-located descriptors of public places provided by social media. The on-line approach makes impossible to adopt machine-learning (classification) techniques, trained on previously gathered data sets. We overcome the problem by adopting an approach based on fuzzy logic: we define a binary fuzzy relation, whose on-line evaluation allows for deciding if two public-place descriptors coming from different social media actually describe the same public place. We tested our technique on three data sets, describing public places in Manchester (UK), Genoa (Italy) and Stuttgart (Germany); the comparison with the off-line classification technique called ``random forest'' proved that our on-line technique obtains comparable results.},

  abstract = {The paper focuses on the end-to-end science operations for the first and only European Mars mission to-date, describing the approaches to science and mission planning and the challenges imposed by the operations constraints. It includes the activities of the instrument and science planning teams to plan and process the collected data. The Mars Express spacecraft has been in orbit around Mars since late 2003. An elliptical, near polar orbit has been chosen as the best trade-off between low-cost launch with little remaining fuel, science operations close to the targets on the Red Planet, and long periods required for transmitting the science data with an affordable communications system. The chosen orbit precesses around Mars, allowing the mapping of the complete surface of Mars at low altitude and good resolution. A high-resolution stereo camera, a mineralogical mapping spectrometer, two atmospheric/surface thermal mapping spectrometers, an energetic neutral atoms analyser, a sub-surface sounding radar and communications equipment in support of lander operations are mounted on the payload face of the spacecraft and compete for observation time, pointing preference and downlink time. The science planning facility performs the trade-off between the competing instrument science requests, planning within an envelope imposed by the power, thermal and illumination resource constraints, as well as the on-board data storage capacity and ground station availability. Different seasonal constraints apply due to the geometry between Mars and Earth, Mars and Sun, but also because of anomalies on the spacecraft that impact the power resource. Once a consolidated science plan has been generated and distributed in the form of a pointing timeline and payload operations requests, the Mars Express mission planning and flight dynamics teams validate the feasibility of the plan. The analysis includes the detailed power usage, spacecraft slew rates, reaction wheel off-loading parameters, illumination and thermal constraint checks. Based on the pointing timeline, orbital events, like eclipses and occultations, and the allocated ground station antennas from the tracking network of the European Space Agency and the Deep Space Network of NASA, the mission planning team generates a communications plan which consists of the switching of the transmitter, downlink and commanding opportunity windows. Tools have been developed within the team to ease and automate the mission planning processes. The tools include the first-ever application based on artificial intelligence technology in mission operations at the European Space Operations Centre (for computing the irregular downlink and uplink plans). Several days prior to execution, the instrument operations requests are updated with detailed and fine-tuned operations parameters. Due to the planning of the instrument operations relative to an orbit event, the execution time uplinked to the instrument is aligned to the latest orbit prediction providing very good accuracy of the orbital events. Once the instrument observations have taken place, the data stored in the on-board mass memory is transferred to the control centre according to the `dump plan', from where the instrument teams pick up the science and housekeeping data for further processing, analysis and publication of the scientific results.},

OLAP is widely used nowadays as it extends special aid to a user, regarding viewing a set of data from various views. To facilitate the analysis further, a multidimensional database is required which is ably supported by MOLAP, a special kind of OLAP. We can extract data from a single MOLAP in different possible ways. There have been many kinds of research to make this analytical process more efficient. But the research area, of extracting data from multiple MOLAPs, has been explored hardly. However, we have proposed a new model for faster querying in multiple MOLAPs using snowflake schema. This model uses array index reference, for creating a MOLAP by joining two-dimensional databases. Thus we can derive summarized MOLAP from fundamental MOLAP. Then we have used summarized MOLAP for creating a fact table, which preserves the summarized data. Our model provides a satisfactory result after comparing it with the MySQL database result.},

  abstract = {RID-List (row id list) intersection is a common strategy in query processing, used in star joins, column stores, and even search engines. To apply a conjunction of predicates on a table, a query process ordoes index lookups to form sorted RID-lists (or bitmap) of the rows matching each predicate, then intersects the RID-lists via an AND-tree, and finally fetches the corresponding rows to apply any residual predicates and aggregates. This process can be expensive when the RID-lists are large. Furthermore, the performance is sensitive to the order in which RID lists are intersected together, and to treating the right predicates as residuals. If the optimizer chooses a wrong order or a wrong residual, due to a poor cardinality estimate, the resulting plan can run orders of magnitude slower than expected. We present a new algorithm for RID-list intersection that is both more efficient and more robust than this standard algorithm. First, we avoid forming the RID-lists up front, and instead form this lazily as part of the intersection. This reduces the associated IO and sort cost significantly, especially when the data distribution is skewed. It also ameliorates the problem of wrong residual table selection. Second, we do not intersect the RID-lists via an AND-tree, because this is vulnerable to cardinality mis-estimations. Instead, we use an adaptive set intersection algorithm that performs well even when the cardinality estimates are wrong. We present detailed experiments of this algorithm on data with varying distributions to validate its efficiency and predictability.},

  abstract = {TARANIS (Tool for the Analysis of RAdiations from lightNIngs and Sprites) mission is designed to study the magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling via transient processes. The transient luminous events (TLEs) - such as elves, sprites and blue jets - are the transient optical phenomena observed at altitudes from 20 to 100 km. These TLEs are sometimes accompanied by terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The TARANIS mission is based on a CNES micro satellite placed in a quasi-polar orbit at around 700 km of altitude to observe stormy regions with an objective to detecting TLEs and TGFs. In order to fulfil the TARANIS mission objectives, the TARANIS system is composed of the satellite and the ground segment. The satellite is associating a Myriade platform and a payload including eight scientific instruments and 2 electronic boxes interfacing between the scientific instruments and the platform.},

  abstract = {Flight controllers manage the orientation and modes of eight large solar arrays that power the International Space Station (ISS). The task requires generating plans that balance complex constraints and preferences. These considerations include context-dependent constraints on viable solar array configurations, temporal limits on transitions between configurations, and preferences on which considerations have priority. The Solar Array Constraint Engine (SACE) treats this operations planning problem as a sequence of tractable constrained optimization problems. SACE uses constraint management and automated planning capabilities to reason about the constraints, to find optimal array configurations subject to these constraints and solution preferences, and to automatically generate solar array operations plans. SACE further provides flight controllers with real-time situational awareness and what-if analysis capabilities. SACE is built on the Extensible Universal Remote Operations Planning Architecture (EUROPA) model-based planning system. EUROPA facilitated SACE development by providing model-based planning, built-in constraint reasoning capability, and extensibility. This article formulates the planning problem, explains how EUROPA solves the problem, and provides performance statistics from several planning scenarios. SACE reduces a highly manual process that takes weeks to an automated process that takes tens of minutes.},

  abstract = {Deep space missions beyond earth orbit will require new methods of data communications in order to compensate for increasing Radio Frequency (RF) propagation delay. The Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard protocols Spacecraft Monitor \& Control (SM\&C), Asynchronous Message Service (AMS), and Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) provide such a method. However, the maturity level of this protocol stack is insufficient for mission inclusion at this time. This Space Data System prototype is intended to provide experience which will raise the Technical Readiness Level (TRL) of this protocol set. In order to reduce costs, future missions can take advantage of these standard protocols, which will result in increased interoperability between control centers. This prototype demonstrates these capabilities by implementing a realistic space data system in which telemetry is published to control center applications at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), and the Johnson Space Center (JSC). Reverse publishing paths for commanding from each control center are also implemented. The target vehicle consists of realistic flight computer hardware running Core Flight Software (CFS) in the integrated Power, Avionics, and Power (iPAS) Pathfinder Lab at JSC. This prototype demonstrates a potential upgrade path for future Deep Space Network (DSN) modification, in which the automatic error recovery and communication gap compensation capabilities of DTN would be exploited. In addition, SM\&C provides architectural flexibility by allowing new service providers and consumers to be added efficiently anywhere in the network using the common interface provided by SM\&C's Message Abstraction Layer (MAL). In FY 2015, this space data system was enhanced by adding telerobotic operations capability provided by the Robot API Delegate (RAPID) family of protocols developed at NASA. RAPID is one of several candidates for consideration and inclusion in a new international standard being developed by the CCSDS Telerobotic Operations Working Group. Software gateways for the purpose of interfacing RAPID messages with the existing SM\&C based infrastructure were developed. Telerobotic monitor, control, and bridge applications were written in the RAPID framework, which were then tailored to the NAO telerobotic test article hardware, a product of Aldebaran Robotics.},

But from experience in different projects, when these analyses are performed at the software level, they are not used to their maximum extent: they are always late and their content is often incomplete (just to justify the already assigned criticality level). They are not always considered as bringing safety and dependability requirements into the project. Existing techniques may be used along all software development and used for many different purposes to support the definition, verification and demonstration of software related safety and dependability characteristics. Therefore the questions are: When are these analyses required? Why are they so difficult to be performed? How are they finally used and why in such a limited way so far? This paper will analyze when these analyses are required, what for, which ones are required by ECSS and evaluate how to better use them in Space projects.},

Due to its telemetry limitation, the mission planning should be carefully done to maximize scientific return. This work defines and simulates the scientific plan to address all sub-objectives under general Objective 3 of the Solar Orbiter mission: 'how do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?' Five new complete Solar Orbiter Observing Plans (SOOPs), for coordinating operations from several (up to 10) instruments, are defined. The SOOPs are scheduled in the Medium-Term Periods (MTPs) within the Science Activity Plan of the full mission, following specific planning strategies, which consider telemetry downlink rates and specific Sun-Earth-S/C configurations. The MTPs are coded and simulated to check when the instruments will be switched on and off and what the resource usage will be, in terms of power and telemetry generation, against the mission's constraints. Before running the code in Experiment Planning Software (EPS), the Objective 3 SOOP timelines are checked with Sous-Chef, a visualization tool for individual instrument observations and SOOPs. The results obtained prove that the process fully addresses Solar Orbiter Objective 3 and it is valid for planning and simulation. It could also be easily adapted to suit other needs in the future, like different trajectories or scientific alternatives, in order to have the best output for science and operations.},

  abstract = {For the operation of Mars rovers the ground team has a set of utilities to generate safe mission planning. A relevant aspect of such planning are the paths that the rover has to to follow to reach the scientific objectives. For path planning, operators use a combination of orbital and surface imagery to analyze the terrain topography to generate a cost map. Applying path planning algorithms over the cost map it is possible to obtain (sub)optimal solutions to safely drive the rover through different waypoints. As well, the paths obtained can be assessed using simulators and handmade improved by means of Virtual Reality techniques. In this paper we present an integrated planner for the mission planning and its evaluation using the recent technological advances in Virtual Reality. We have developed a low cost application to provide a three-dimensional view of the path generated exploiting real Mars surfaces with the aim of helping operators in deciding the best paths to follow.},

The goal of this solver is to find a feasible conflict-free assignment of a set of objects to be tracked by a set of sensors, given several constraints. We use an off-the-shelf temporal planner to solve this problem, Optic. A key aspect of this task is that problems are usually huge. Thus, current temporal planners can not solve those problems directly. We explain first how to model the problem as a temporal planning problem, and then we present an approach for partitioning the problem in order to be able to solve it that allows a multi-core processing. The experimental results, both with simulated and real data, confirm the approach is useful for solving target problems of realistic size.},

The force due to solar radiation pressures encountered by the PSP spacecraft, particularly at the 9.86 solar-radii (Rs) closest approach point in the orbit, are of a sufficient magnitude to produce significant disturbance torques. Inside of 0.25 AU, the Observatory is required to keep its Thermal Protection System (TPS) pointed precisely towards the Sun in order to ensure the survivability of the observatory. It was crucial to reduce disturbance torques encountered during this phase of flight to a low enough level such that the guidance and control system of the spacecraft would be able to control attitude without requiring excessive or untimely propellant usage. We present the process used for proactively packaging a balanced spacecraft and analytically determining the spacecraft's mass properties throughout the entirety of the mission, including associated CG and inertia tensor changes due to propellant usage and movement of deployable hardware and mechanisms. We also present the process used for deriving the spacecraft's CP based on the geometry and optical properties of the hardware exposed to the full solar environment, as well as its shift due to degradation of those properties throughout the life of the mission. Using both of those data sets, we present the approach used to install ballast masses on the observatory in order to minimize the offset, as well as data collected during spacecraft mass properties testing concluded towards the end of PSP's assembly, test, and launch operations campaign. Finally, we present test correlated center of gravity and center of pressure data, and examine expected effects for the duration of the Parker Solar Probe mission.},

  abstract = {Human exploration of the solar system brings a host of environmental and engineering challenges. Among the most important factors in crew health and human performance is the preservation of mental health. The mental well-being of astronaut crews is a significant issue affecting the success of long-duration space missions, such as habitation on or around the Moon, Mars exploration, and eventual colonization of the solar system. If mental health is not properly addressed, these missions will be at risk. Upkeep of mental health will be especially difficult on long duration missions because many of the support systems available to crews on shorter missions will not be available. In this paper, we examine the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) simulations to maintain healthy mental states in astronaut crews who are removed from the essential comforts typically associated with terrestrial life. Various methods of simulations and their administration are analyzed in the context of current research and knowledge in the fields of psychology, medicine, and space sciences, with a specific focus on the environment faced by astronauts on long-term missions. The results of this investigation show that virtual reality should be considered a plausible measure in preventing mental state deterioration in astronauts, though more work is needed to provide a comprehensive view of the effectiveness and administration of VR methods.},

  abstract = {Objects that possess mass (e.g., automobiles, manufactured items, etc.) translationally accelerate in direct proportion to the force applied scaled by the object\&rsquo;s mass in accordance with Newton\&rsquo;s Law, while the rotational companion is Euler\&rsquo;s moment equations relating angular acceleration of objects that possess mass moments of inertia. Michel Chasles\&rsquo;s theorem allows us to simply invoke Newton and Euler\&rsquo;s equations to fully describe the six degrees of freedom of mechanical motion. Many options are available to control the motion of objects by controlling the applied force and moment. A long, distinguished list of references has matured the field of controlling a mechanical motion, which culminates in the burgeoning field of deterministic artificial intelligence as a natural progression of the laudable goal of adaptive and/or model predictive controllers that can be proven to be optimal subsequent to their development. Deterministic A.I. uses Chasle\&rsquo;s claim to assert Newton\&rsquo;s and Euler\&rsquo;s relations as deterministic self-awareness statements that are optimal with respect to state errors. Predictive controllers (both continuous and sampled-data) derived from the outset to be optimal by first solving an optimization problem with the governing dynamic equations of motion lead to several controllers (including a controller that twice invokes optimization to formulate robust, predictive control). These controllers are compared to each other with noise and modeling errors, and the many figures of merit are used: tracking error and rate error deviations and means, in addition to total mean cost. Robustness is evaluated using Monte Carlo analysis where plant parameters are randomly assumed to be incorrectly modeled. Six instances of controllers are compared against these methods and interpretations, which allow engineers to select a tailored control for their given circumstances. Novel versions of the ubiquitous classical proportional-derivative, \&ldquo;PD\&rdquo; controller, is developed from the optimization statement at the outset by using a novel re-parameterization of the optimal results from time-to-state parameterization. Furthermore, time-optimal controllers, continuous predictive controllers, and sampled-data predictive controllers, as well as combined feedforward plus feedback controllers, and the two degree of freedom controllers (i.e., 2DOF). The context of the term \&ldquo;feedforward\&rdquo; used in this study is the context of deterministic artificial intelligence, where analytic self-awareness statements are strictly determined by the governing physics (of mechanics in this case, e.g., Chasle, Newton, and Euler). When feedforward is combined with feedback per the previously mentioned method (provenance foremost in optimization), the combination is referred to as \&ldquo;2DOF\&rdquo; or two degrees of freedom to indicate the twice invocation of optimization at the genesis of the feedforward and the feedback, respectively. The feedforward plus feedback case is augmented by an online (real time) comparison to the optimal case. This manuscript compares these many optional control strategies against each other. Nominal plants are used, but the addition of plant noise reveals the robustness of each controller, even without optimally rejecting assumed-Gaussian noise (e.g., via the Kalman filter). In other words, noise terms are intentionally left unaddressed in the problem formulation to evaluate the robustness of the proposed method when the real-world noise is added. Lastly, mismodeled plants controlled by each strategy reveal relative performance. Well-anticipated results include the lowest cost, which is achieved by the optimal controller (with very poor robustness), while low mean errors and deviations are achieved by the classical controllers (at the highest cost). Both continuous predictive control and sampled-data predictive control perform well at both cost as well as errors and deviations, while the 2DOF controller performance was the best overall.},

The low cost and short development time of CubeSats make such miniature spacecraft interesting for a variety of applications. A particularly appealing future field of application for nanosatellites is On-Orbit Servicing of existing orbital assets. A number of mission concepts foresee the employment of miniature spacecraft to perform a variety of operations on orbital vehicles, ranging from inspection and monitoring to assembly and repairing. In this framework, the development of technologies that enable proximity navigation and/or docking between a nanosatellite chaser and a target object is of interest. In particular, miniaturized navigation sensors for the estimation of relative position and attitude of the involved vehicles are required. The work presented here focuses on the development of an IR-based relative navigation sensor compatible with CubeSat standard nanosatellites. The system estimates the relative pose and position of the target by taking images of the object, which is equipped with retro-reflecting fiducial markers illuminated by an array of IR LEDs on the chaser. The system architecture and operation are described, and preliminary laboratory test results are presented.},

The main disadvantage with such vehicles is the limitation of available resources to perform mission tasks. To overcome this drawback, mission concepts are under study that foresee cooperation between autonomous small satellites to accomplish complex tasks; among these, on-orbit servicing and on-orbit assembly of large structures are of particular interest and the global scientific community is putting a significant effort in the miniaturization of critical technologies that are required for such innovative mission scenarios. In this work, the development and the laboratory testing of an accurate relative navigation package for nanosatellites compliant to the CubeSat standard is presented. The system features a small camera and two sets of LED fiducial markers, and is conceived as a standard package that allows small spacecraft to perform mutual tracking during rendezvous and docking maneuvers. The hardware is based on off-the-shelf components assembled in a compact configuration that is compatible with the CubeSat standard. The image processing and pose estimation software was custom developed. The experimental evaluation of the system allowed to determine both the static and dynamic performances. The system is capable to determine the close range relative position and attitude faster than 10 S/s, with errors always below 10 mm and 2 deg.},

We propose a new discovery-driven exploration paradigm that mines the data for such exceptions and summarizes the exceptions at appropriate levels in advance. It then uses these exceptions to lead the analyst to interesting regions of the cube during navigation. We present the statistical foundation underlying our approach. We then discuss the computational issue of nding exceptions in data and making the process e cient on large multidimensional data bases.},

  abstract = {Modern Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) such as SystemVerilog or VHDL are, due to their sheer complexity, insufficient to transport designs through modern circuit design flows. Instead, each design automation tool lowers HDLs to its own Intermediate Representation (IR). These tools are monolithic and mostly proprietary, disagree in their implementation of HDLs, and while many redundant IRs exists, no IR today can be used through the entire circuit design flow. To solve this problem, we propose the LLHD multi-level IR. LLHD is designed as simple, unambiguous reference description of a digital circuit, yet fully captures existing HDLs. We show this with our reference compiler on designs as complex as full CPU cores. LLHD comes with lowering passes to a hardware-near structural IR, which readily integrates with existing tools. LLHD establishes the basis for innovation in HDLs and tools without redundant compilers or disjoint IRs. For instance, we implement an LLHD simulator that runs up to 2.4x faster than commercial simulators but produces equivalent, cycle-accurate results. An initial vertically-integrated research prototype is capable of representing all levels of the IR, implements lowering from the behavioural to the structural IR, and covers a sufficient subset of SystemVerilog to support a full CPU design.},

Various combinations of data obtained from different providers can be used to enhance the lives of citizens with respect to different characteristics such as transport, city planning, the environment and housing. However, data provided from these streams is not necessarily in a format suitable for analysis and OLAP queries, despite the fact that these streams often provide measures and some elements of dimensionality often found in OLAP queries. In this research, we present a StarGraph construct which is designed to import web generated data streams and automatically generate the cube format necessary for OLAP queries. Our validation shows how the data streams can be captured as StarGraphs and using a traffic data case study, demonstrates an efficiency for populating and updating the data cube.},

We begin with an analysis of requirements that such an AI system should satisfy in order to be practically applicable in video game development, and identify the elements of the DRL model used in the DeepCrawl prototype. The successes and limitations of DeepCrawl are documented through a series of playability tests performed on the final game. We believe that the techniques we propose offer insight into innovative new avenues for the development of behaviors for non-player characters in video games, as they offer the potential to overcome critical issues with classical approaches.},

  abstract = {Graph pattern mining methods can extract informative and useful patterns from large-scale graphs and capture underlying principles through the overwhelmed information. Contrast analysis serves as a keystone in various fields and has demonstrated its effectiveness in mining valuable information. However, it has been long overlooked in graph pattern mining. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce the concept of contrast subgraph, that is, a subset of nodes that have significantly different edges or edge weights in two given graphs of the same node set. The major challenge comes from the gap between the contrast and the informativeness. Because of the widely existing noise edges in real-world graphs, the contrast may lead to subgraphs of pure noise. To avoid such meaningless subgraphs, we leverage the similarity as the cornerstone of the contrast. Specifically, we first identify a coherent core, which is a small subset of nodes with similar edge structures in the two graphs, and then induce contrast subgraphs from the coherent cores. Moreover, we design a general family of coherence and contrast metrics and derive a polynomial-time algorithm to efficiently extract contrast subgraphs. Extensive experiments verify the necessity of introducing coherent cores as well as the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. Real-world applications demonstrate the tremendous potentials of contrast subgraph mining.},

  abstract = {High power Earth and orbital-based directed energy (DE) systems pose a potential hazard to Earth orbiting spacecraft. The use of very high power, large aperture DE systems to propel spacecraft is being pursued as the only known, feasible method to achieve relativistic flight in our NASA Starlight and Breakthrough Starshot programs. In addition, other beamed power mission scenarios, such as orbital debris removal and our NASA program using DE for powering high performance ion engine missions, pose similar concerns. It is critical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam with the approximately 2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have modeled the interception of the beam with satellites by using their orbital parameters and computing the likelihood of interception for many of the scenarios of the proposed systems we are working on. We are able to simulate both the absolute interception as well as the distance and angle from the beam to the spacecraft, and have modeled a number of scenarios to obtain general probabilities. We have established that the probability of beam interception of any active satellite, including its orbital position uncertainty, during any of the proposed mission scenarios is low (\$\textbackslash approx10\^\{-4\}\$). The outcome of this work gives us the ability to predict when to energize the beam without intercept, as well as the capability to turn off the DE as needed for extended mission scenarios. As additional satellites are launched, our work can be readily extended to accommodate them. Our work can also be used to predict interception of astronomical adaptive optics guide-star lasers as well as more general laser use.},

Tuples of a data cube can be divided into closed-tuples and non-closed tuples. For any non-closed tuple, there exists a closed-tuple, and both are aggregated from the same set of tuples in a base table and have the same aggregated value. By removing all non-closed tuples, a data cube can be translated to a closed data cube. The algorithm of computing a closed data cube is given, answering a query and maintaining the closed data cube incrementally. The results of experiments are also presented by using both the synthetic and real-world data sets. The experimental results show that the closed data cube technique is effective.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a new Agile Earth Observation Satellite (AEOS) mission planning algorithm. This new developed algorithm is based on Modified Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach, which takes the minimum slew angle and highest priority criterion. The key point of the paper lies in that the planning process is treated as a Dynamical Combinatorial Optimization (DCO) problem due to the time-varying constraint and the requirement of the problem. The design of the new algorithm is also to meet the real-time requirement of onboard mission planning. The mathematical formulation of the problem is modified to satisfy the demand of the LP solver, and a newly developed dynamic database is used to simulate the constantly changing satellite-target relative position with limited observation windows. The new mission planning model is solved by the LP method to test its reliability. Another solution with Generic Algorithm (GA) is also given to check the result. The calculation time of these two methods is compared to show that the LP approach has a better compatibility with the onboard mission planning requirement.},

  abstract = {A new approach to mission operations has been flight validated on NASA's Deep Space One (DS1) mission that launched in October 1998. The beacon monitor operations technology is aimed at decreasing the total volume of downlinked engineering telemetry by reducing the frequency of downlink and the volume of data received per pass. Cost savings are achieved by reducing the amount of routine telemetry processing and analysis performed by ground staff. With beacon monitoring, the spacecraft will assess its own health and will transmit one of four subcarrier frequency tones to inform the ground how urgent it is to track the spacecraft for telemetry. If all conditions are nominal, the tone provides periodic assurance to ground personnel that the mission is proceeding as planned without having to receive and analyze downlinked telemetry. If there is a problem, the tone will indicate that tracking is required and the resulting telemetry will contain a concise summary of what has occurred since the last telemetry pass. The beacon technology has been proven successful on DS1 through a series of tone tests and data summarization experiments. This collection of experiments was called the DS1 Beacon Monitor Experiment or BMOX. There are important lessons still to be learned from this experiment that can be applied to future spacecraft missions},

  abstract = {Nowadays, analysis data volumes are reaching critical sizes challenging traditional data warehousing approaches. Cubing methods based on inverted indices, such as Frag-Cubing, are efficient alternatives to conventional approaches of computing OLAP data cubes over Big Data. However, similar to other memory-based cube solutions, the efficiency of such methods is constrained by available dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). In this paper, we implement and test the hybrid inverted cubing (HIC) method, which adopts a hybrid memory system, with main goal of able to compute and update BIG data cubes (with high dimensionality and high number of tuples). HIC stores the most frequent attribute values in DRAM; the remaining attribute values are retained in external memory. Tests using a relation with 480 dimensions and 107 tuples show that HIC is three times slower than Frag-Cubing when computing a data cube, and approximately 13 times faster than Frag-Cubing when answering complex cube queries. A BIG data cube with 60 dimensions and 109 tuples was computed by HIC using 110 GB of RAM and 286 GB of external memory, while Frag-Cubing could not compute such a cube in same machine.},

Nevertheless, the multiplicity of possible applications and the continuing search for better computational performance has motivated researchers in continuing to propose new methods, as well as improvements on existing ones. Not only optimization has allowed a better exploration of the design space, it also can significantly reduce the time of the design process. In this paper the advantages of using a fully multiobjective and multicase approach for the design of space radiators is presented. The optimization of Amazonia-1 satellite batteries panel thermal design is investigated. Instead of conventional space radiators, in this work an innovative solution considering the fin as heat absorber is analyzed. The results have shown that there are several viable configurations regarding to fin coating material, heater power consumption and additional mass, and the choice of the appropriate radiator configuration shall be evaluated based on system impact. The possibility of testing automatically different coatings and sizes for the fin, allowed by the optimization approach, increased significantly the probability of finding viable solutions on the design space.},

  abstract = {Wigner and Huntington first predicted that pressures of order 25 GPa were required for the transition of solid molecular hydrogen to the atomic metallic phase. Later it was predicted that metallic hydrogen might be a metastable material so that it remains metallic when pressure is released. Experimental pressures achieved on hydrogen have been more than an order of magnitude higher than the predicted transition pressure and yet it remains an insulator. We discuss the applications of metastable metallic hydrogen to rocketry. Metastable metallic hydrogen would be a very light-weight, low volume, powerful rocket propellant. One of the characteristics of a propellant is its specific impulse, Isp . Liquid (molecular) hydrogen-oxygen used in modern rockets has an Isp of \textasciitilde 460s; metallic hydrogen has a theoretical Isp of 1700 s! Detailed analysis shows that such a fuel would allow single-stage rockets to enter into orbit or carry economical payloads to the moon. If pure metallic hydrogen is used as a propellant, the reaction chamber temperature is calculated to be greater than 6000 K, too high for currently known rocket engine materials. By diluting metallic hydrogen with liquid hydrogen or water, the reaction temperature can be reduced, yet there is still a significant performance improvement for the diluted mixture.},

Big Data Analytics (BDA) is increasingly becoming a trending practice that many organizations are adopting with the purpose of constructing valuable information from BD.

However, there are different types of analytic applications to consider. Therefore, prior to hasty use and buying costly BD tools, there is a need for organizations to first understand the BDA landscape.

Yet using magnetometers for attitude determination is not straightforward because of the sensor errors. These errors limit the overall achievable attitude determination accuracy. Thus far different methods to cope with magnetometer errors and calibrate the magnetometers have been proposed. A new research field is the specific errors for magnetometers onboard the small satellites and their time-variation characteristics. In accordance, algorithms which consider also the time-varying error terms are proposed. This paper reviews the recent calibration algorithms for small satellite magnetometers. The survey mainly covers batch and recursive estimation algorithms which are capable of estimating the time-varying magnetometer error terms. It presents the foundation of each algorithm and covers issues about the algorithm design, application and performance. In the end possible directions in this research field are briefly discussed.},

This paper uses Nanjing, China as a case study and examines the possibility of using the data cube technique in data mining to understand space\textendash time travel patterns of Nanjing rail transit users. One month of smartcard data in October, 2013 was obtained from Nanjing rail transit system, with a total of over 22 million transaction records. We define the original data cube for the smartcard data based on four dimensions\textemdash Space, Date, Time, and User, design a hierarchy for each dimension, and use the total number of transactions as the quantitative measure. We develop modules using the programming language Python and share them as open-source on GitHub to enable peer production and advancement in the field. The visualizations of two-dimensional slices of the data cube show some interesting patterns such as different travel behaviors across user groups (e.g. students vs. elders), and irregular peak hours during National Holiday (October 1st\textendash 7th) compared to regular morning and afternoon peak hours during regular working weeks. Spatially, multidimensional visualizations show concentrations of various activity opportunities near metro rail stations and the changing popularities of rail stations through time accordingly. These findings support the feasibility and efficiency of the data cube technique as a mean of visual exploratory analysis for massive smart-card data, and can contribute to the evaluation and planning of public transit systems.},

Since arrival in July 2016, it has used 9 science investigations to study the planet's atmospheric composition and structure, magnetic and gravity fields, and polar and extended magnetosphere. A radiation monitoring investigation contributes to our understanding of Jupiter's environment. Juno's primary science goal is to understand the origin and evolution of Jupiter, to shed light on how the Earth and other planets formed. Baseline objectives will be satisfied with 32 science orbits, a spin-stabilized solar powered spacecraft, an electronics vault for radiation shielding, and a robust payload with microwave receivers, X- and Ka-band radio science hardware, vector magnetometers, high- and low-energy charged particle detectors, radio and plasma wave antennas, UV and IR spectroscopic imagers, and a visible light camera for public outreach. Observations are made in a limited number of orientations, including Gravity Science (spin axis and main antenna pointing to Earth), and microwave atmospheric sounding (spin plane passing through Jupiter's center). Prime science data are collected near closest approach (perijove), plus calibrations, occasional remote sensing, and continued magnetospheric observations in the outer parts of the orbit. Juno's mission plan has evolved since the 2005 proposal due to design and ops choices, e.g., mission design (cruise or early orbital trajectory), orbit period (11, 14, then 53 days), perijove attitudes (2 or more), and DSN coverage (34- and 70-m stations). Choices were partly motivated by the effect on science return. Selected preliminary science results are summarized, including the benefits of decisions as the plan evolved. Juno has begun to unveil Jupiter - peeling apart its interior by measuring gravity and magnetic fields, using microwaves to probe its atmosphere down to 100s of km, exploring its polar and extended magnetosphere, and imaging the poles for the first time. In doing so, it is revealing secrets of the history of the Earth and solar system.},

  abstract = {CubeSats are small spacecraft based on a 10cm by 10cm by 10cm (1U) cube standard that have historically only been operated in Earth orbit. Mars Cube One (MarCO) is the first CubeSat mission developed for interplanetary operation. MarCO is a technology demonstration mission comprised of two identical, solar powered 6U satellites with several key goals, including that of providing a bent pipe telecom relay to Earth for NASA's InSight (Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport) mission during its Entry, Descent, and Landing sequence. MarCO launched on the same rocket as InSight and makes use of the Deep Space Network for communications and ranging. It therefore has an attitude control system and propulsion system suitable for operating in several pointing modes, providing desaturations for reaction wheel momentum buildup, and thrusting to change the spacecraft trajectory. Because the spacecraft design is constrained to the CubeSat standards and because of the distances of the spacecraft from Earth and the Sun, the components used for attitude control and propulsion must meet tight size, mass, and power requirements. Autonomous modes of operation are also critical to ensure that the spacecraft can function safely with periods of several hours occurring between consecutive communication periods. A robust testing sequence was required to ensure that the spacecraft functions were exercised and that the operations team understood how the spacecraft were expected to behave after launch. This paper discusses several elements of the MarCO attitude control and propulsion systems. The paper begins with a discussion of the hardware that was selected for the two systems as well as descriptions of the interface between the attitude control and propulsion systems and the interface between these systems and the rest of the spacecraft's command and data handling system. Next, the paper summarizes the different types of tests that were performed at the system and spacecraft levels. Test data is included for some of these tests which helped define the methods by which the spacecraft is operated in space. Lastly, the paper lists a series of lessons-learned for developing attitude control and propulsion systems for interplanetary CubeSats.},

These papers presented reasons and experimental evidence that showed that the major RDBMS vendors can be outperformed by 1--2 orders of magnitude by specialized engines in the data warehouse, stream processing, text, and scientific database markets. Assuming that specialized engines dominate these markets over time, the current relational DBMS code lines will be left with the business data processing (OLTP) market and hybrid markets where more than one kind of capability is required. In this paper we show that current RDBMSs can be beaten by nearly two orders of magnitude in the OLTP market as well. The experimental evidence comes from comparing a new OLTP prototype, H-Store, which we have built at M.I.T. to a popular RDBMS on the standard transactional benchmark, TPC-C. We conclude that the current RDBMS code lines, while attempting to be a "one size fits all" solution, infact, excel at nothing. Hence, they are 25 year old legacy code lines that should be retired in favor of a collection of "from scratch" specialized engines. The DBMS vendors (and the research community) should start with a clean sheet of paper and design systems for yesterday's needs.},

  abstract = {Hydro-, Aeolian and Solar energy show significant promise in helping to reduce pollutants and greenhouse gases, which is a primary focus in today's sustainable development culture. To enjoy the power of them, the human society needs solutions to transform the energies mentioned above into electric energy, at specific reliability, efficiency and sustainability parameters. Maintaining this kind of parameters implies, among other things, the careful and permanent monitoring of equipment. The monitoring process implies remote monitoring, as we are talking about preserving natural resources. The equipment is mostly situated in the middle of nature, covering large areas mostly outside of populated locations. In their great majority installations for wind and solar energy have been designed and manufactured relatively recently, which makes them contain systems of tele-monitoring that are designed and included by default, as a part of great importance to the entire investment. The situation is different in the case of hydroelectric plants, which have a tradition of over 130 years and have been and are still built to this day. Renewable energy sources are being increasingly used and need to be constantly monitored for optimizing the power grid. Unfortunately, such micro power plants are located in difficult to access remote locations where often only satellite or sparse GSM radio signals are available. In this paper we study the way how to process big data gathered by a decentralized cloud system, based on general systems and remote telemetry units (RTUs), for tele-monitoring of renewable energy objectives. Also, we analyze a proposed cloud M2M system, where each RTU communicates by radio with a telemetry data gateway connected to a cloud computing infrastructure equipped with appropriate software that delivers processed data. Furthermore, we present how we use a search based application built on Exalead CloudView to search for weak signals in big data. In particular, given the telemetry application, we propose to leverage trivial and non-trivial connections between different sensor signals and data from other online environmental wireless sensor networks, in order to find patterns that are likely to provide innovative solutions to existing problems. The aggregation of such weak signals will provide evidence of connections between renewable energies and environmental related issues faster and better than trivial mining of sensor data. As a consequence, the software has a significant potential for matching environmental applications and challenges that are related in non-obvious ways. Finally, we present the measurement results for a hydro-energy case study and discuss the applicability for other renewable sources such as solar or wind energy.},

The purpose of this paper is to present the environmental measurements performed with ground telemetry systems near the Black Sea coast in the Danube Delta and the fusion of sensor data with datasets from EO satellite applications. We present the BEIA telemetry system that has been installed and is further being developed for the National Administration ``Romanian Waters'' (ANAR), an automatic system able to continuously monitor the level and water temperature along the Danube, Danube Delta and some of its tributary rivers. Furthermore, we demonstrate how big data processing software can be used for extracting non-trivial correlations from telemetry and EO data.

They are likely to be important in adaptation to the demands of flying in a space crew. Autobiographical interviews with 20 retired long-duration male cosmonauts were scored for references to three core motives: the needs for Achievement, Power, and Affiliation. Overall, the cosmonauts mentioned need for Affiliation most often, followed by need for Achievement, with need for Power the least frequently mentioned. However, need for Power increased between reminiscences of one's pre-flight career to those concerning the in-flight and post-flight periods. Imagery related to both other needs decreased. Cosmonauts who had spent less than a year in space mentioned need for Achievement significantly more frequently than those who had spent more than a year. Other space-experience and demographic variables, and changes across pairs of career phases, were not significant. The high scores for need for Affiliation indicate the importance of selecting compatible teams and fostering friendship and cooperation during training and deployment. A relatively flat hierarchical organization would be harmonious with low Power motivation; but the increase during missions indicates a desire for autonomy. After retirement from spaceflight, former space crews should be afforded opportunities for leadership and decision-making to satisfy continuing need for Power. Comparison is made to the same measures applied to a sample of ISS crewmembers, and to the ISS vs. veteran data for 8 cosmonauts who were included in both sets of data.},

However, due to the complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of multivariate time series, their anomaly detection remains a big challenge. This paper proposes OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly for various devices. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies. Moreover, for a detected entity anomaly, OmniAnomaly can provide interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate time series. The evaluation experiments are conducted on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset (collected and released by us) from an Internet company. OmniAnomaly achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.86 in three real-world datasets, signicantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.09. The interpretation accuracy for OmniAnomaly is up to 0.89.},

Hence manufacturers are forced to utilize the best methods of technology with efficient control and management accompanied by suitably enabling organizational structures. Concurrent engineering (CE) is widely seen to be the methodology that can help satisfy these strenuous demands and keep the profitability and viability of product developers, manufacturers and suppliers high. There have been many reported successes of CE in practice. Rover were able to launch Land Rover Discovery in 18 months as compared with 48-63 months for similar products in Europe. Because of its early introduction to the market it became the best selling product in its class. AT\&T report part counts down to one ninth of their previous levels and quality one hundred times (in surface defects) for VLSI (very improvements of large scale integration) circuits as a result of using the CE approach. WHO SHOULD READ THIS TEXT? This book will aim to provide a sound basis for the very diverse subject known as concurrent engineering. Concurrent engineering is recognized by an increasingly large proportion of the manufacturing industry as a necessity in order to compete in today's markets. This recognition has created the demand for information, awareness and training in good concurrent engineering practice.},

Although the first targets for mining will be the most accessible near Earth objects (NEOs), the Main Belt contains 106 times more material by mass. The large scale expansion of this new asteroid mining industry is contingent on being able to rendezvous with Main Belt asteroids (MBAs), and so on the velocity change required of mining spacecraft (delta-v). This paper develops two different flight burn schemes, both starting from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and ending with a successful MBA rendezvous. These methods are then applied to the \$700,000 asteroids in the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database with well-determined orbits to find low delta-v mining targets among the MBAs. There are 3986 potential MBA targets with a deltav {$<$} 8 km s\`A1, but the distribution is steep and reduces to just 4 with delta-v {$<$} 7 km s-1. The two burn methods are compared and the orbital parameters of low delta-v MBAs are explored.},

Only water offers the diversity of chemical properties and reactivity, including the existence of the three common physical states within a limited temperature range of service to life, avoiding the issues presented by any alternatives. They must, like us, possess a large, abstract-thinking brain, and probably possess at least all the fundamental senses that humankind possess. They would also be carbon-based life, using oxygen as the electron sink of their biochemistry for the reasons considered. They most likely are homeothermic as us, though they may not necessarily be mammalian as we are. Their biochemistry could differ some from ours, perhaps presenting contact hazards for both species as discussed.},

  abstract = {The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission is the fourth Solar Terrestrial Probe (STP) program of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The MMS mission was launched on March 12, 2015. The mission consists of four identically instrumented spinstabilized spacecraft flying in a tetrahedral formation to study the magnetosphere of the Earth. As the MMS formation moves in orbit during the different science observation phases, the apparent Sun position shifts such that MMS experiences variable eclipse durations. By the end of the primary science observation phase, September 2017, MMS completed 792 orbits and had experienced 683 eclipse events. Seventy-four percent of the eclipse events lasted for less than 1 hour long while fourteen percent lasted between 1 hour and 2 hours long, and the remaining twelve percent lasted between 2 hours and 3.5 hours long. MMS eclipse configuration rules, inherited from pre-launch test results and analyses, implement spacecraft suite and instrument suite power configurations as well as heater and temperature setting management for eclipse durations up to 4 hours long. In August 2019, as the mission progresses into extended science observation phases, MMS is predicted to experience eclipse durations of 3.7 hours, 5.2 hours, 4.4 hours, and 2.8 hours long on four consecutive orbits. The 4.4 hour and 5.2 hour long eclipse events are longer than any tested during pre-launch energy balance simulation and analyses. This paper discusses the energy balance analyses and results obtained for the four long August 2019 MMS eclipse orbits amending existing MMS eclipse configuration rule sets.},

  abstract = {As smallsats become increasingly capable, longer-lived, and have more secondary payload launch opportunities to beyond-GEO destinations, they are expected to play an increasing role in deep space science investigations. This expectation is borne out by several relatively recent NASA Science Mission Directorate solicitations regarding smallsat studies and small innovative missions. With the potential for these smallsats to substantially add to the number of spacecraft operating in deep space, we need to be thinking about ways to support communications with all of them without the huge expense of trying to build a commensurate number of deep space antennas. One approach to this challenge might involve making greater use of beam-sharing techniques that allow all the spacecraft within the beamwidth of a single ground antenna to simultaneously downlink to the antenna. One of these techniques, Opportunistic Multiple Spacecraft Per Antenna (OMSPA), may be particularly suited to smallsats. In the concept for this technique, smallsats within the scheduled ground antenna beam of some other spacecraft, make opportunistic use of that spacecraft's beam by transmitting ``open-loop'' to a recorder associated with the antenna. These transmissions get captured on the recorder and can be later retrieved, demodulated, and decoded so that the smallsats can recover their data \textendash{} all without them having to schedule the antenna itself and compete with larger missions for antenna time. Widespread use of such a technique could lead to more efficient use of receiver antenna resources and result in a dramatic increase in downlink throughput. An opportunity to demonstrate the technique occurred in May 2018, when the Mars CubeSat One (MarCO) mission, consisting of two nanospacecraft (MarCO-A \& B) launched alongside InSight, a NASA Mars lander mission. To demonstrate the capabilities of OMSPA for this launch window opportunity, X-band downlink telemetry was recorded for all three spacecraft (InSight, MarCO-A, and MarCO-B) at both the Deep Space Network (DSN), using its 34-m antennas, and at Morehead State University (MSU) using its 21-m antenna \textendash{} with all of the involved antennas pointed at InSight. Open-loop recordings were collected at the DSN using wideband very long baseline science receivers and at MSU using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices operated using GNU Radio. All the recordings were then processed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology (JPL) using an OMSPA Software Receiver, a signal processing/communications tool used to extract telemetry transfer frames from baseband samples. The results of extracting telemetry data from InSight/MarCO recordings collected by the DSN and at MSU are described in this article. In particular, details pertaining to the processing chain used by the OMSPA Software Receiver to demodulate the DSN and MSU recordings are presented, from carrier/symbol synchronization, to frame alignment using attached sync markers (ASMs), followed by error correction code decoding. Validation results with closed-loop data obtained by the DSN are also presented in order to highlight the viability of OMSPA for future multiple spacecraft demodulation opportunities.},

  abstract = {Electrical and electronic systems can be disturbed by radiation-induced effects. In some cases, radiation-induced effects are of a low probability and can be ignored; however, radiation effects must be considered when designing systems that have a high mean time to failure requirement, an impact on protection, and/or higher exposure to radiation. High-energy physics power systems suffer from a combination of these effects: a high mean time to failure is required, failure can impact on protection, and the proximity of systems to accelerators increases the likelihood of radiationinduced events. This paper presents the principal radiation-induced effects, and radiation environments typical to high-energy physics. It outlines a procedure for designing and validating radiation-tolerant systems using commercial off-the-shelf components. The paper ends with a worked example of radiation-tolerant power converter controls that are being developed for the Large Hadron Collider and High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider at CERN.},

  abstract = {Operational satellite simulator models require updates in order to  reflect the behavior of the actual satellite, especially after  several years of flight operations. Because it can be extremely  costly to modify them manually, a software tool for autonomous  reconfiguration of operational simulator behavior models is  proposed. To implement such a feature, behavior models must be  reassessed and reevaluated to identify the need of model updates  and to trigger them. This can be achieved by periodically  monitoring discrepancies between the satellite telemetry and the  simulator parameters. This paper describes a procedure for  comparative analysis between telemetry and simulation parameters  for an autonomous reconfiguration tool for operational simulator  behavior models for synchronization.},

  abstract = {In recent years, commercial exploitation of small satellites and CubeSats has rapidly increased. Time to market of processed customer data products is becoming an important differentiator between solution providers and satellite constellation operators. Timely and accurate data dissemination is the key to success in the commercial usage of small satellite constellations which is ultimately dependent on a high degree of autonomous fleet management and automated decision support. The traditional way for disseminating data is limited by on the communication capability of the satellite and the ground terminal availability. Even though cloud computing solutions on the ground offer high analytical performance, getting the data from the space infrastructure to the ground servers poses a bottleneck of data analysis and distribution. On the other hand, adopting advanced and intelligent algorithms onboard offers the ability of autonomy, tasking of operations, and fast customer generation of low latency conclusions, or even real-time communication with assets on the ground or other sensors in a multi-sensor configuration. In this paper, the advantages of intelligent onboard processing using advanced algorithms for Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) compliant onboard data processing systems are explored. The onboard data processing architecture is designed to handle a large amount of high-speed streaming data and provides hardware redundancy to be qualified for the space mission application domain. We conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance analysis by using image recognition algorithms based on an open source intelligent machine library ``MIOpen'' and an open standard ``OpenVX''. OpenVX is a cross-platform computer vision library.},

  abstract = {Many global catastrophic risks are threatening human civilization, and a number of ideas have been suggested for preventing or surviving them. However, if these interventions fail, society could preserve information about the human race and human DNA samples in the hopes that the next civilization on Earth will be able to reconstruct Homo sapiens and our culture. This requires information preservation of an order of magnitude of 100 million years, a little-explored topic thus far. It is important that a potential future civilization discovers this information as early as possible, thus a beacon should accompany the message in order to increase visibility. The message should ideally contain information about how humanity was destroyed, perhaps including a continuous recording until the end. This could help the potential future civilization to survive. The best place for long-term data storage is under the surface of the Moon, with the beacon constructed as a complex geometric figure drawn by small craters or trenches around a central point. There are several cost-effective options for sending the message as opportunistic payloads on different planned landers.},

  abstract = {Radiometric tracking data from Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft has consistently indicated the presence of a small, anomalous, Doppler frequency drift, uniformly changing with a rate of \textasciitilde 6 x 10\^\{-9\} Hz/s; the drift can be interpreted as a constant sunward acceleration of each particular spacecraft of a\_P = (8.74 \textbackslash pm 1.33) x 10\^\{-10\} m/s\^2. This signal is known as the Pioneer anomaly; the nature of this anomaly remains unexplained. We discuss the efforts to retrieve the entire data sets of the Pioneer 10/11 radiometric Doppler data. We also report on the recently recovered telemetry files that may be used to reconstruct the engineering history of both spacecraft using original project documentation and newly developed software tools. We discuss possible ways to further investigate the discovered effect using these telemetry files in conjunction with the analysis of the much extended Doppler data. We present the main objectives of new upcoming study of the Pioneer anomaly, namely i) analysis of the early data that could yield the direction of the anomaly, ii) analysis of planetary encounters, that should tell more about the onset of the anomaly, iii) analysis of the entire dataset, to better determine the anomaly's temporal behavior, iv) comparative analysis of individual anomalous accelerations for the two Pioneers, v) the detailed study of on-board systematics, and vi) development of a thermal-electric-dynamical model using on-board telemetry. The outlined strategy may allow for a higher accuracy solution for a\_P and, possibly, will lead to an unambiguous determination of the origin of the Pioneer anomaly.},

Some works in remote sensing missions developed algorithms to minimize maximum revisit time or to evaluate by geometrical approaches the average access time to a certain target.This paper, following early works on single satellite mission analysis for intermittent coverage, concentrates on manipulation of the ground track patterns of satellite constellations. The task, then, is to describe an orbit design analysis oriented to obtain efficient revisit coverages and repeat cycles by instruments embarked on satellite constellations deployed on one or more orbital planes.If the patterns are superimposed properly, it is possible either to reduce the minimum grid spacing (related to the swath width of the onboard instrument) or to increase the revisit frequency on the same trace.The analysis is limited to the study of constellations consisting of satellites located on circular orbits with the same altitude and inclination.Results are depicted, by considering an orbit analysis for observation of the Mediterranean area.},

  abstract = {This book provides a basic, conceptual-level description of engineering management disciplines that relate to the development and life cycle management of a system. For the non-engineer it provides an overview of how a system is developed. For the engineer and project manager it provides a basic framework for planning and assessing system development. Information in the book is from various sources, but a good portion is taken from lecture material developed for the two Systems Planning, Research, Development, and Engineering courses offered by the Defense Acquisition University. The book is divided into four parts: Introduction; Systems Engineering Process; Systems Analysis and Control; and Planning, Organizing, and Managing. The first part introduces the basic concepts that govern the systems engineering process and how those concepts fit the Department of Defense acquisition process. Chapter 1 establishes the basic concept and introduces terms that will be used throughout the book. The second chapter goes through a typical acquisition life cycle showing how systems engineering supports acquisition decision making. The second part introduces the systems engineering problem-solving process, and discusses in basic terms some traditional techniques used in the process. An overview is given, and then the process of requirements analysis, functional analysis and allocation, design synthesis, and verification is explained in some detail. This part ends with a discussion of the documentation developed as the finished output of the systems engineering process. Part three discusses analysis and control tools that provide balance to the process. Key activities (such as risk management, configuration management, and trade studies) that support and run parallel to the system engineering process are identified and explained. Part four discusses issues integral to the conduct of a systems engineering effort, from planning to consideration of broader management issues. In some chapters supplementary sections provide related material that shows common techniques or policy-driven processes. These expand the basic conceptual discussion, but give the student a clearer picture of what systems engineering means in a real acquisition environment.},

  abstract = {Mining colossal itemsets from high dimensional datasets have gained focus in recent times. The conventional algorithms expend most of the time in mining small and mid-sized itemsets, which do not enclose valuable and complete information for decision making. Mining Frequent Colossal Closed Itemsets (FCCI) from a high dimensional dataset play a highly significant role in decision making for many applications, especially in the field of bioinformatics. To mine FCCI from a high dimensional dataset, the existing preprocessing techniques fail to prune the complete set of irrelevant features and irrelevant rows. Besides, the state-of-the-art algorithms for the same are sequential and computationally expensive. The proposed work highlights an Effective Improved Parallel Preprocessing (EIPP) technique to prune the complete set of irrelevant features and irrelevant rows from high dimensional dataset and a novel efficient Parallel Frequent Colossal Closed Itemset Mining (PFCCIM) algorithm. Further, the PFCCIM algorithm is integrated with a novel Rowset Cardinality Table (RCT), an efficient method to check the closeness of a rowset and also an efficient pruning strategy to cut down the mining search space. The proposed PFCCIM algorithm is the first parallel algorithm to mine FCCI from a high dimensional dataset. The performance study shows the improved effectiveness of the proposed EIPP technique over the existing preprocessing techniques and the improved efficiency of the proposed PFCCIM algorithm over the existing algorithms.},

Transmission of tones or PN sequences drain power and bandwidth that could be better used for transmitting additional science data from the spacecraft. Here we describe and evaluate a novel technique that extracts range and Doppler estimates directly from the decoded data, thus enabling data-transmission at the maximum rate consistent with spacecraft range, antenna gain and available signal power. In this paper, the structure of the maximum likelihood estimator for range and Doppler is derived, and its performance determined relative to Crame\^A\textquestiondown r-Rao bounds via simulation and analysis. Performance of conventional Doppler and delay estimators based on carrier tracking loops is also derived, and contrasted with the performance of the optimum Doppler-delay estimator over a range of symbol SNR typically encountered in deep-space applications.},

Recently, we introduced a two-way ranging method ([1]\textendash [3]) which eliminates the need for the downlink PN ranging signal. In this telemetry ranging scheme, the requisite timing measurements are obtained from a data-bearing downlink telemetry signal. In the present paper, we extend the telemetry ranging concept by also eliminating the uplink PN signal, which is replaced by a data-bearing telecommand signal. We describe the architecture and concept of such a system, and describe the fundamental limitations of tracking the timing of uplink telecommand signals when demod-remod correlation techniques are employed via Cramer-Rao bounds. An end-to-end performance analysis shows that in typical scenarios, ranging performance comparable to conventional PN ranging can be achieved.},

As a stepping stone to this goal, the domain of StarCraft has emerged as an important challenge for artificial intelligence research, owing to its iconic and enduring status among the most difficult professional esports and its relevance to the real world in terms of its raw complexity and multi-agent challenges. Over the course of a decade and numerous competitions1\textendash 3, the strongest agents have simplified important aspects of the game, utilized superhuman capabilities, or employed hand-crafted sub-systems4. Despite these advantages, no previous agent has come close to matching the overall skill of top StarCraft players. We chose to address the challenge of StarCraft using general-purpose learning methods that are in principle applicable to other complex domains: a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm that uses data from both human and agent games within a diverse league of continually adapting strategies and counter-strategies, each represented by deep neural networks5,6. We evaluated our agent, AlphaStar, in the full game of StarCraft II, through a series of online games against human players. AlphaStar was rated at Grandmaster level for all three StarCraft races and above 99.8\% of officially ranked human players. AlphaStar uses a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm and has reached Grandmaster level, ranking among the top 0.2\% of human players for the real-time strategy game StarCraft II.},

The current SCC system adopts the architecture of a relational database mounted by NAS to manage data. In recent years, with more refined management of on-orbit satellites, the long-term trend analysis of satellite telemetry data is needed on qualitative quantitative analysis of satellite components' performance, satellite failure status and so on. The performance of the current database system is poor, and the big data processing capacity is limited, which is difficult to meet engineering requirements. With the rapid development of the big data technology, a series of processing architectures adapting to mass data are generated, which provide the technical approach for solving the problem of telemetry data analysis and mining. The paper designs the satellite telemetry data storage and analysis architecture based on HBase, which is the first time to introduce the non-relational database into the design of SCC database, breaks through the current system bottlenecks. The prototype experiment shows that it is able to realize the second level response of telemetry data extraction and analysis in condition of the large time span, which has a significance for further engineering application.},

  abstract = {Recently proposed techniques have finally made it possible for analysts to interactively explore very large datasets in real time. However powerful, the class of analyses these systems enable is somewhat limited: specifically, one can only quickly obtain plots such as histograms and heatmaps. In this paper, we contribute Gaussian Cubes, which significantly improves on state-of-the-art systems by providing interactive modeling capabilities, which include but are not limited to linear least squares and principal components analysis (PCA). The fundamental insight in Gaussian Cubes is that instead of precomputing counts of many data subsets (as state-of-the-art systems do), Gaussian Cubes precomputes the best multivariate Gaussian for the respective data subsets. As an example, Gaussian Cubes can fit hundreds of models over millions of data points in well under a second, enabling novel types of visual exploration of such large datasets. We present three case studies that highlight the visualization and analysis capabilities in Gaussian Cubes, using earthquake safety simulations, astronomical catalogs, and transportation statistics. The dataset sizes range around one hundred million elements and 5 to 10 dimensions. We present extensive performance results, a discussion of the limitations in Gaussian Cubes, and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Inverted list compression is a topic that has been studied for 50 years due to its fundamental importance in numerous applications including information retrieval, databases, and graph analytics. Typically, an inverted list compression algorithm is evaluated on its space overhead and query processing time. Earlier list compression designs mainly focused on minimizing the space overhead to reduce expensive disk I/O time in disk-oriented systems. But the recent trend is shifted towards reducing query processing time because the underlying systems tend to be memory-resident. Although there are many highly optimized compression approaches in main memory, there is still a considerable performance gap between query processing over compressed lists and uncompressed lists, which motivates this work. In this work, we set out to bridge this performance gap for the first time by proposing a new compression scheme, namely, MILC (memory inverted list compression). MILC relies on a series of techniques including offset-oriented fixed-bit encoding, dynamic partitioning, in-block compression, cache-aware optimization, and SIMD acceleration. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets in information retrieval, databases, and graph analytics to demonstrate the high performance and low space overhead of MILC. We compare MILC with 12 recent compression algorithms and experimentally show that MILC improves the query performance by up to 13.2\texttimes{} and reduces the space overhead by up to 4.7\texttimes.},

In general, RS data processing involves a complex multi-stage processing sequence, which comprises several independent processing steps according to the type of RS application. RS data processing for regional environmental and disaster monitoring is recognized as being computationally intensive and data intensive. We propose pipsCloud to address these issues in an efficient manner, which combines recent cloud computing and HPC techniques to obtain a large-scale RS data processing system that is suitable for on-demand real-time services. Due to the ubiquity, elasticity, and high-level transparency of the cloud computing model, massive RS data management and data processing for dynamic environmental monitoring can all be performed on the cloud via Web interfaces. A Hilbert-R+-based data indexing method is employed for the optimal querying and access of RS images, RS data products, and interim data. In the core platform beneath the cloud services, we provide a parallel file system for massive high-dimensional RS data, as well as interfaces for accessing irregular RS data to improve data locality and optimize the I/O performance. Moreover, we use an adaptive RS data analysis workflow management system for on-demand workflow construction and the collaborative processing of a distributed complex chain of RS data, e.g., for forest fire detection, mineral resources detection, and coastline monitoring. Our experimental analysis demonstrated the efficiency of the pipsCloud platform.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge for Machine Learning (ML) prognostic analyses of large-scale time series databases is variable clock skew between/among multiple data acquisition (DAQ) systems across assets in a fleet of monitored assets, and even inside individual assets, where the sheer numbers of sensors being deployed are so large that multiple individual DAQs, each with their own internal clocks, can create significant clock-mismatch issues. For Big Data prognostic anomaly detection, we have discovered and amply demonstrated that variable clock skew issues in the timestamps for time series telemetry signatures cause poor performance for ML prognostics, resulting in high false-alarm and missed-alarm probabilities (FAPs and MAPs). This paper describes a new Analytical Resampling Process (ARP) that embodies novel techniques in the time domain and frequency domain for interpolative online normalization and optimal phase coherence so that all system telemetry time series outputs are available in a uniform format and aligned with a common sampling frequency. More importantly, the "optimality" of the proposed technique gives end users the ability to select between "ultimate accuracy" or "lowest overhead compute cost", for automated coherence synchronization of collections of time series signatures, whether from a few sensors, or hundreds of thousands of sensors, and regardless of the sampling rates and signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios for those sensors.},

  abstract = {Data cubes are widely used as a powerful tool to provide multidimensional views in data warehousing and On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP). However, with increasing data sizes, it is becoming computationally expensive to perform data cube analysis. The problem is exacerbated by the demand of supporting more complicated aggregate functions (e.g. CORRELATION, Statistical Analysis) as well as supporting frequent view updates in data cubes. This calls for new scalable and efficient data cube analysis systems. In this paper, we introduce HaCube, an extension of MapReduce, designed for efficient parallel data cube analysis on large-scale data by taking advantages from both MapReduce (in terms of scalability) and parallel DBMS (in terms of efficiency). We also provide a general data cube materialization algorithm which is able to facilitate the features in MapReduce-like systems towards an efficient data cube computation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how HaCube supports view maintenance through either incremental computation (e.g. used for SUM or COUNT) or recomputation (e.g. used for MEDIAN or CORRELATION). We implement HaCube by extending Hadoop and evaluate it based on the TPC-D benchmark over billions of tuples on a cluster with over 320 cores. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency, scalability and practicality of HaCube for cube analysis over a large amount of data in a distributed environment.},

However, analysts need to issue multidimensional queries. For example, an analyst may need to select not just the most profitable stores or--separately--the most profitable products, but simultaneous sets of stores and products fulfilling some profitability constraints. To fill this need, we propose a new operator, the diamond dice. Because of the interaction between dimensions, the computation of diamonds is challenging. We present the first diamond-dicing experiments on large data sets. Experiments show that we can compute diamond cubes over fact tables containing 100 million facts in less than 35 minutes using a standard PC.},

As the Space Situational Awareness (SSA) problem grows with more and more objects in space, more sophistication is needed to understand the available data. Moving from centralized processing to distributed analysis leans in to the distributed nature of the SSA problem - sensors and targets of interest are spread from the earth's surface to cis-lunar space. By pushing more processing to the edge, we can increase the overall level of autonomy of the sensor network. Distributed decision-making allows greater flexibility and resilience to changing local circumstances. Here, we architect a machine learning framework to show how an autonomous sensor swarm might be designed from a scheduling perspective. The simulated swarm uses Long-Short Term memory to provide schedules, which are then used to evaluate the orbit configuration.},

The model organizes all the different data in both relational database and in the memories and is able to support analysis-requirements-oriented data extractions. Based on this datacube, an O\&M data mining approach is proposed with procedures of data preparation, data clustering and data mining. The proposed datacube-based data mining approach was applied to the Kunming Chang Shui international airport terminal. More than 7 years on-site repairing data were used for data mining and the outcomes verified the model and the approach to be feasible and valuable for improving O\&M management.},

  abstract = {Earth observation satellites are platforms equipped with optical instruments that orbit the earth to take photographs of specific areas at users' requests. Compared with huge user requests, satellites are still scanty resources. For some task, the satellite has to roll its camera to take the desired image. However, many satellites are rigidly restricted on maneuverability. As a result, the performances of satellites are greatly confined. Therefore, we need a scientific observation plan to weaken the constraints arising from satellites' poor slew ability. To solve the problem we present a multi satellites scheduling algorithm based on task merging mechanism. The algorithm partitions the problem into two sub-problems: task assignment and task merging. In task assignment, we propose an adaptive ant colony optimization algorithm to select specific time window for each task, creating a task list for each satellite. In task merging, we propose the concept of task combination and develop a dynamic programming algorithm to find the best merging plan for each satellite. The two sub-problems are logically coupled; a valid observation plan will be got after much iteration. Finally, a series of test examples are given out, which demonstrate our algorithm to be effective.},

  abstract = {Observed in many real applications, a top-k query often consists of two components to reflect a user's preference: a selection condition and a ranking function. A user may not only propose ad hoc ranking functions, but also use different interesting subsets of the data. In many cases, a user may want to have a thorough study of the data by initiating a multi-dimensional analysis of the top-k query results. Previous work on top-k query processing mainly focuses on optimizing data access according to the ranking function only. The problem of efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections has not been well addressed yet.This paper proposes a new computational model, called ranking cube, for efficient answering top-k queries with multi-dimensional selections. We define a rank-aware measure for the cube, capturing our goal of responding to multi-dimensional ranking analysis. Based on the ranking cube, an efficient query algorithm is developed which progressively retrieves data blocks until the top-k results are found. The curse of dimensionality is a well-known challenge for the data cube and we cope with this difficulty by introducing a new technique of ranking fragments. Our experiments on Microsoft's SQL Server 2005 show that our proposed approaches have significant improvement over the previous methods.},

  abstract = {Data cube computation is one of the most essential but expensive operations in data warehousing. Previous studies have developed two major approaches, top-down versus bottom-up. The former, represented by the multiway array cube (called the multiway) algorithm, aggregates simultaneously on multiple dimensions; however, it cannot take advantage of a priori pruning when computing iceberg cubes (cubes that contain only aggregate cells whose measure values satisfy a threshold, called the iceberg condition). The latter, represented by BUC, computes the iceberg cube bottom-up and facilitates a priori pruning. BUC explores fast sorting and partitioning techniques; however, it does not fully explore multidimensional simultaneous aggregation. In this paper, we present a new method, star-cubing, that integrates the strengths of the previous two algorithms and performs aggregations on multiple dimensions simultaneously. It utilizes a star-tree structure, extends the simultaneous aggregation methods, and enables the pruning of the group-bys that do not satisfy the iceberg condition. Our performance study shows that star-cubing is highly efficient and outperforms the previous methods},

Firstly, in order to prove the features of small world and power law, the device system is parsed into an undirected network including nodes and paths, by which complex networks theory is applied in device network model. The nodes which have high degree or high clustering coefficient are acquired as referenced nodes for simulating malfunctions by analyzing the network and computing the parameters of the nodes, providing high-efficient key points monitor strategy. An example is taken about a TT\&C system, in which 9 nodes are proposed to be important nodes that affect the feature of small world and 6 nodes are proved to influence the connection of the network, accounting 12\% of the total model. The result can provide theoretical support for device maintenance, lowering the consumption.},

  abstract = {The characteristic of the satellite repeat shift time can reflect the status of the satellite operation, and is also one of the key factors of the sidereal filtering multipath correction. Although some methods have been developed to calculate the repeat shift time, few efforts have been made to analyze and compare the performance of this feature for the GPS (Global Positioning System), BDS (BeiDou System), and Galileo in depth. Hence, three methods used for calculating the repeat shift time are presented, and used to compare and analyze the three global systems in depth, named the broadcast ephemeris method (BEM), correlation coefficient method (CCM), and aspect repeat time method (ARTM). The experiment results show that the repeat shift time of each satellite is different. Also, the difference between the maximum and minimum varies from different systems. The maximum difference is about 25 s for the BDS IGSO (Inclined Geosynchronous Orbit) and the minimum is merely 10 s for the GPS system. Furthermore, for the same satellite, the shift time calculated by the three methods is almost identical, and the maximum difference is only about 7 s between the CCM and the ARTM method for the BDS MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) satellite. Although the repeat shift time is different daily for the same satellite and the same method, the changes are very small. Moreover, in terms of the STD (Standard Deviation) of the BS (between satellites) and MS (mean shift for the same satellite), the GPS system is the best, the performance of the BDS system is medium, and the Galileo performs slightly worse than the GPS and BDS.},

The prototype system provides forestry operator with the service of browsing forestry data and various management plans. Based on the concept of data cube, the entire forest is a data cube, each individual tree as a basic data cube. By using the data cube design by us, we could construct the virtual forest on different scale using less computer memory. With the help of the visualization system, we can compute the spatial construction information of the forest and adjust the spatial structure, providing a basic platform and virtual environment for other researchers to study spatial structure of forest.},

Under this circumstance, the data management function, which services as the core of the satellite network O\&M system, is faced with the serious management challenges brought by the huge amount and complex datasets. In this paper, we study the distributed cooperative storage management technologies for big data management issue in satellite network O\&M. We propose a distributed cooperative big data storage model for the satellite network O\&M, and further study the intra-site hybrid database management strategy and inter-site fast data synchronization technology, to improve the scalability and disaster tolerance of data service in the O\&M application. Finally, we evaluate the hybrid database architecture based on Oracle and HBase using the benchmark, and compare the theoretical network traffic with the actual flow measured by GoldenGate, then perform the quantitative analysis on the system disaster tolerance of data services.},

The text cube is built on a multidimensional text database, where each row is associated with some text data (e.g., a document) and other structural dimensions (attributes). A cell in the text cube aggregates a set of documents with matching attribute values in a subset of dimensions. A cell document is the concatenation of all documents in a cell. Given a keyword query, our goal is to find the top-k most relevant cells (ranked according to the relevance scores of cell documents w.r.t. the given query) in the text cube. We define a keyword-based query language and apply IR-style relevance model for scoring and ranking cell documents in the text cube. We propose two efficient approaches to find the top-k answers. The proposed approaches support a general class of IR-style relevance scoring formulas that satisfy certain basic and common properties. One of them uses more time for pre-processing and less time for answering online queries; and the other one is more efficient in pre-processing and consumes more time for online queries. Experimental studies on the ASRS dataset are conducted to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

Such new measures allow users to model, smooth, and predict the trends and patterns of data. Existing algorithms for simple distributive and algebraic measures are inadequate for efficient computation of statistical measures in a multidimensional space. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new class of measures, compressible measures, in order to support efficient computation of the statistical models. For compressible measures, we compress each cell into an auxiliary matrix with a size independent of the number of tuples. We can then compute the statistical measures for any data cell from the compressed data of the lower-level cells without accessing the raw data. Time- and space-efficient lossless aggregation formulae are derived for regression and filtering measures. Our analytical and experimental studies show that the resulting system, regression cube, substantially reduces the memory usage and the overall response time for statistical analysis of multidimensional data},

This paper proposed a new partitioning algorithm, called Double Table Switch (DTS). It sets up two table spaces in the memory at the beginning, where the partitioned results in one table are copied into another table alternatively during the bottom-up computation. Thus DTS avoids the costly space management and achieves the constant memory usage. Further, we improve the DTS algorithm by adjusting the dimension order, etc. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of DTS.},

However, the imaging process is complex due to the amount of computation required at high resolutions and the large number of visibilities present in observation data. The required accuracy and computational cost of such imaging represent one of the largest challenges facing the new generation of radio interferometers such as the Square Kilometre Array. In this paper, we present a new hybrid algorithm, called w-facets, that is based on an existing faceting algorithm and the w-projection algorithm. The idea for w-facets is based on using a faceting algorithm to split a wide-field of view into small facets and handling each facet using the w-projection algorithm. We compare the image quality and imaging time by using the faceting, w-projection and w-facets algorithms. The data show that the imaging quality obtained from the hybrid algorithm is better than that obtained from the faceting or w-projection algorithms separately. In addition, the w-facets algorithm gives a good robust estimate and small dynamic range on the bright source. However, one shortcoming is that the imaging time required by the w-facets algorithm is longer, and this time requirement will affect widespread use of the hybrid method in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The present society has been sculpted into a continuous data generator. In fact, the massive automatic data collection has generated a new genre of dataset, termed as `high-dimensional data', which is characterized by a relatively small number of rows, in comparison to that of large number of columns (or dimensions). Among the vast data mining tasks, association rules have been extensively employed so as to describe the correlations between the variables found in a dataset. The task of mining association rules highly relies on the efficiency of the algorithms to extract all frequent itemsets that exist in the database. The focus towards improving run time and memory consumption of algorithms is strongly influenced by search strategies, effective pruning strategies, and the method of closure checking. Neither depth- nor breadth-first search may exert any variance without these techniques, mainly because the search space appears similar. With that, this paper investigated the strategies implemented in both row and column enumeration-based algorithms, hence proposing the RARE; a breadth-first bottom-up row-enumeration algorithm, in mining colossal closed itemsets in high-dimensional data.},

To accelerate such a process, we first define a new problem called mining algorithm roadmap in scientific publications, and then propose a new weakly supervised method to build the roadmap. The algorithm roadmap describes evolutionary relation between different algorithms, and sketches the undergoing research and the dynamics of the area. It is a tool for analysts and researchers to locate the successors and families of algorithms when analyzing and surveying a research field. We first propose abbreviated words as candidates for algorithms and then use tables as weak supervision to extract these candidates and labels. Next we propose a new method called Cross-sentence Attention NeTwork for cOmparative Relation (CANTOR) to extract comparative algorithms from text. Finally, we derive order for individual algorithm pairs with time and frequency to construct the algorithm roadmap. Through comprehensive experiments, our proposed algorithm shows its superiority over the baseline methods on the proposed task.},

  abstract = {Ant colony optimization (ACO) based method is proposed for the design of the active debris removal mission (ADR), wherein the maximum number of debris pieces are required to be removed in one year with limited vehicle's propellant mass. The methodology consists two phased: the first phase estimates both rendezvous time and cost by a fast procedure, and the second phase obtains an optimal removal sequence. Specifically, the estimation procedure is worked based on the use of the J2 effect to minimize propellant consumption. Then, the design of the considered ADR mission is mapped into increasingly complex variants to the classic Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). To solve it, an enhanced ACO is applied. The effectiveness of the ACO heuristic is proved over a set of instances with different size ranging from 100 to 324. The computational results show that the proposed methodology can select optimally targets from debris archive with considerable size (up to 324 debris pieces). In addition, the mitigation of thirteen to sixteen objects, with total {$\increment$}V below 1km/s, is feasible in less than a year.},

Before launching, various experiments are usually carried out on the spacecraft to thoroughly examine its performance and reliability, resulting in a large amount of experiment/test data. During its operation in orbit, the spacecraft will periodically generate operation data which can be collected by ground stations. The analysis and management of the spacecraft experiment and operation big data are essential for the monitoring of the system health and the prediction of potential failures. In this paper, we propose a complete framework for the collection, cleansing, storage, analysis and visualization of the spacecraft experiment and operation big data. All components of this framework such as the database, webserver and middleware are built on mature open source software frameworks. This big data framework has been deployed on a number of Linux servers and operates well in production.},

At first, all cubes will be established and their aggregate value will be calculated in the Mapping stage. All the key/value pair formed in Mapping stage will be passed to Reducing stage. Equivalence partitioning will be carried out In this stage, and the minimum aggregation cube of each equivalence partitioning will be the key with its aggregate value. According to the minimum aggregation cubes, we can get the quotient cubes. In order to improve the speed of parallel computing and reduce network traffic, equivalence class division will be executed locally after the Map stage, it is named as combiner stage. In this paper, MapReduce model is used to improve the efficiency of building quotient cube because of its ability of parallel computing in a large amount of data. In addition, the experiment proved that, under certain circumstances, increasing the number of Mapper/Reducer task can reduce the building time effectively, and improve the construction efficiency.},

  abstract = {Set intersection is an important operation and widely used in both database and graph analytics applications. However, existing state-of-the-art set intersection methods only consider the size of input sets and fail to optimize for the case in which the intersection size is small. In real-world scenarios, the size of most intersections is usually orders of magnitude smaller than the size of the input sets, e.g., keyword search in databases and common neighbor search in graph analytics. In this paper, we present FESIA, a new set intersection approach {$\surd$}on modern CPUs. The time complexity of our approach is O(n/ w + r), in which w is the SIMD width, and n and r are the size of input sets and intersection size, respectively. The key idea behind FESIA is that it first uses bitmaps to filter out unmatched elements from the input sets, and then selects suitable specialized kernels (i.e., small function blocks) at runtime to compute the final intersection on each pair of bitmap segments. In addition, all data structures in FESIA are designed to take advantage of SIMD instructions provided by vector ISAs with various SIMD widths, including SSE, AVX, and the latest AVX512. Our experiments on both realworld and synthetic datasets show that our intersection method achieves more than an order of magnitude better performance than conventional scalar implementations, and up to 4x better performance than state-of-the-art SIMD implementations.},

In this paper, we propose a new infrastructure called MicroTextCluster Cube (or MiTexCube) to support efficient online text analysis on multidimensional text databases by introducing micro-clusters of text documents as a compact representation of text content. Experimental results on real multidimensional text databases show that (i) MiTexCube can be materialized efficiently with reasonable overhead in space, and (ii) applications based on the proposed materialized MiTexCube are more efficient than the baseline method of direct analysis based on document units in each cell, without sacrificing much quality of analysis, and MiTexCube naturally accommodates flexible trade-off between efficiency and quality of analysis. \textcopyright{} 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {The satellite system is one of the most efficient means for broadcasting due to its wide service coverage as well as the fact that it can provide high data rate services by using high frequency bands. However, there are a number of problems in the satellite system, such as a long round trip delay (RTD) and heterogeneity of the channel conditions of the earth stations. Even though utilizing adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) is almost mandatory for the satellite systems using high frequency bands due to the serious rain fading, the long RTD makes it difficult to quickly respond to channel quality information, resulting in a decrease in the efficiency of ACM. A high heterogeneity of earth stations caused by a wide service coverage also makes it difficult to apply a uniform transmission mode, and thus satellite systems require receiver-dependent transmission modes. A rateless code can be an effective means to compensate for these disadvantages of satellite systems compared to terrestrial wireless systems. This paper presents soft iterative decoding algorithms for efficient application of rateless codes in satellite systems and demonstrates that rateless codes can be effectively used for hybrid automatic repeat request schemes.},

When the Data Cube is generated, the high-dimensional data is divided into several low-dimensional data fragments by using the idea of partitioning cubes into dimension attributes. For each dimension data segment, the closed cubes of each dimension data segment are calculated using the closed cube calculation. A query bitmap is added to each fragment, and a query index table of closed segments is constructed by using bit map index technology to reduce the storage space occupied by the result set and to increase the query efficiency. Based on the application of multidimensional analysis of water conservancy census data, it is proved that this method can effectively reduce the storage space of cube data of water conservancy census data and improve the efficiency of OLAP (online analytical processing) query.},

Data warehouses and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) technology have proven to be effective tools for decision support on relational data. However, they are not well-equipped to handle the new yet important multidimensional networks. In this paper, we introduce Graph Cube, a new data warehousing model that supports OLAP queries effectively on large multidimensional networks. By taking account of both attribute aggregation and structure summarization of the networks, Graph Cube goes beyond the traditional data cube model involved solely with numeric value based group-by's, thus resulting in a more insightful and structure-enriched aggregate network within every possible multidimensional space. Besides traditional cuboid queries, a new class of OLAP queries, crossboid, is introduced that is uniquely useful in multidimensional networks and has not been studied before. We implement Graph Cube by combining special characteristics of multidimensional networks with the existing well-studied data cube techniques. We perform extensive experimental studies on a series of real world data sets and Graph Cube is shown to be a powerful and efficient tool for decision support on large multidimensional networks.},
