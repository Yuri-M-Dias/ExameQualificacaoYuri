  doi = {10/gfzm3s},
  abstract = {Mars Express (MEX) has been orbiting Mars, generating great science for over 13 years. The aging spacecraft faces challenges; eclipse seasons are getting longer, eclipse durations are increasing and battery degradation is worsening. Accurate power modelling, respecting the power budget, becomes more vital as this ensures MEX health and maximum science. Empirical thermal power models provide reliable long term predictions but lack sensitivity. Telemetry data accumulated during the mission is a rich information source from which to derive a new model. This paper shows how the MEX Flight Control Team released 3 Martian years of data and reached out to Machine Learning (ML) enthusiasts asking them to predict a fourth year of spacecraft telemetry. In return, the participants were invited to an open data day to meet the MEX operators, tour ESA and find out about many exciting missions, and present and share their solutions with other candidates and ESA staff members. But the reward of solving a complex challenge, in a novel environment for space application, lead an incredible response from the worldwide ML community. Using open source solutions, candidates built data-driven models which have been able to predict the power consumption of 33 thermal lines, every hour, over a full Martian year (687 Earth days). These models improve sensitivity and accuracy by an order of magnitude. The number of scientific observations may increase even during power constrained periods when incorporating such models into MEX mission planning. By releasing spacecraft data and engaging with ML communities, ESA has gained a novel means to better exploit spacecraftresources, increase scientific return, and so, prolong mission life.},

  abstract = {A machine learning approach for the operational situational awareness (OSA) in flight operations is presented. The spacecraft health and safety telemetry are generally time dependent and periodical. The machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, are used to capture the time dependent trend of the telemetry datasets characterized by their data patterns and noise level, which provides a direct insights into the health and safety status of telemetry datasets. As the time dependent trends are highly sensitive to changes above the noise level, the potential anomalies can be detected at much early stage, which leads to a more proactive flight operations and a more resilient system. The challenges for the machine-learning approach in the spacecraft ground system are to develop a systematic, accurate, adaptive and efficient data training strategy, and a representation to meet persistent requirement. The focus of this paper is to present a machine-learning approach for the time dependent trending of spacecraft datasets with arbitrary scales. The data training algorithms have been developed and implemented in neural networks, which are shown to generate highly accurate time dependent trend. The OSA tool, ASRC Intelligent Monitoring System (AIMS), is presented, which implements the machine-learning algorithm. The extensions of machine-learning algorithms in developing capabilities to improve the mission efficiency and enable more autonomous operations are discussed.},

  title = {The {{Amazonia}}-1 Satellite’s Ground Segment - Challenges for Implementation of the Space Link Extension Protocol Services},
  abstract = {Amazonia-1 is the first Remote Sensing Satellite entirely  developed at Brazil by National Institute for Space Research  (INPE) and it is expected to be concluded in 2018. Amazonia-1 is a  polar orbit satellite that will generate images with a 5 days  revisit period. To do this, has a wide sight optical imager,  called Wide Field Imager (WFI), able to observe a range of 700 km  with 70 meters of spatial resolution. Its rapid revisit feature  will enable Amazon deforestation alert data to improve in real  time by maximizing the acquisition of useful images in the face of  cloud cover in the region. The Amazonia-1 will also provide  frequent images of Brazilian areas, and may be useful in other  environmental monitoring applications, such as the coastal zone,  water reservoirs, forests of other biomes and natural disasters.  The Amazonia-1 satellite is based on the Multi-Mission Platform  (MMP), which was also developed by INPE and other Brazilian  industries as a part of the National Program of Space Activities  (PNAE), coordinated by the Brazilian Space Agency (AEB). The MMP  is generic platform to 500 kg class satellites. With 250 kg mass,  it provides the necessary resources, in terms of power, control,  communication and others to operate, in orbit, a payload of up to  280 kg. The requirement of high rate of revisits and the need of  controlling and data reception of other remote sensing satellites  available in Brazil, for example, the CBERS (26 days to revisit)  impose new challenges for the ground segment, related to control  system of orbit and attitude and consequently in the reception,  processing and distribution of data through the ground segment  using the Space Link Extension (SLE) Protocol Services. The SLE  protocol services establish activities, based on the Consultative  Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) for cross support  recommendations, including Management Services for Data Transfer  and SLE protocol services related to Telemetry and Telecommand.  These services standards have been adopted by the different space  agencies, such as: ESA, NASA, CNES, DLR, ASI, JAXA, INPE, to  performing tracking and controlling of the spacecrafts. This paper  presents an overview of the Amazonia-1 satellites ground segment,  its objectives, the satellite design based in the Multi-Mission  Platform (MMP) and also the preparation of the ground segment for  the operation with the SLE Protocol and allow for efficient  operations with cross support.},

Before launching, various experiments are usually carried out on the spacecraft to thoroughly examine its performance and reliability, resulting in a large amount of experiment/test data. During its operation in orbit, the spacecraft will periodically generate operation data which can be collected by ground stations. The analysis and management of the spacecraft experiment and operation big data are essential for the monitoring of the system health and the prediction of potential failures. In this paper, we propose a complete framework for the collection, cleansing, storage, analysis and visualization of the spacecraft experiment and operation big data. All components of this framework such as the database, webserver and middleware are built on mature open source software frameworks. This big data framework has been deployed on a number of Linux servers and operates well in production.},

The HST was designed for a minimum fifteen-year mission with on-orbit servicing by the Space Shuttle System planned at approximately three-year intervals. Major changes to the HST ground system are planned to be in place for the third servicing mission in December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system reengineering effort, a project called 'vision December 1999. The primary objectives of the ground system re-engineering effort, a project called 'vision 2000 control center systems (CCS)', are to reduce both development and operating costs significantly for the remaining years of HST's lifetime. Development costs will be reduced by providing a modern hardware and software architecture and utilizing commercial of f the shelf (COTS) products wherever possible. Operating costs will be reduced by eliminating redundant legacy systems and processes and by providing an integrated ground system geared toward autonomous operation. Part of CCS is a Space Telescope Engineering Data Store, the design of which is based on current Data Warehouse technology. The purpose of this data store is to provide a common data source of telemetry data for all HST subsystems. This data store will become the engineering data archive and will include a queryable database for the user to analyze HST telemetry. The access to the engineering data in the Data Warehouse is platform- independent from an office environment using commercial standards. Latest internet technology is used to reach the HST engineering community. A WEB-based user interface allows easy access to the data archives. This paper will provide a high level overview of the CCS system and will illustrate some of the CCS telemetry capabilities. Samples of CCS user interface pages will be given. Vision 2000 is an ambitious project, but one that is well under way. It will allow the HST program to realize reduced operations costs for the Third Servicing Mission and beyond.},

  abstract = {Limited telemetry bandwidth due to restricted radio frequency spectrum allocation is typically one of the most challenging problems when designing a telemetry system for space applications. To further complicate the problem, a large percentage of the allotted bandwidth is consumed by the over-head required by each packet to follow various standards and layer of protocols used in the telemetry system. This results in inefficiency in the actual telemetry data downlinked to the ground station. In the typical telemetry design, only one virtual channel is used per packet. As a result, in order to achieve the required packet size, filled data is inserted into the remaining bits. This Idle Packet consists of a set pattern of binary digits, and is considered part of the overhead, as its sole purpose is to fill the packet. In this work, a new scheme is proposed which takes advantage of the empty bits by starting the next virtual channel instead of inserting filled bits. This method will reduce the overall amount of overheard, in addition to allowing more data to be transmitted.},

  doi = {10.1109/CBD.2014.12},
  abstract = {The correlation analysis of telemetry data plays a significant role in satellite performance analysis. However, the existing methods cannot be well applied, because the telemetry data is large and high-dimensional. In this paper, an efficient algorithm named QARC Apriori is proposed. First, to reduce the redundant attributes and lower the problem complexity, grey relational analysis method is applied. Second, each filtered attribute is partitioned into several subintervals, combining with K-Means clustering algorithm. During clustering, the outliers are removed to improve the accuracy of clustering results. Due to different distributions and scopes of attributes, the clustering centers are automatically adjusted. Moreover, the statistical information of each attribute is used to avoid repeatedly scanning database. Finally, all quantitative association rules are mined by an improved Apriori algorithm. In order to improve the mining efficiency, two pruning strategies are used. The experiments are conducted with the power supply data of a China's satellite from 2011.6.1 to 2011.9.1. It indicates that the proposed algorithm is suitable for quantitative association rules mining and is important for satellite on-orbit performance analysis.},

This paper identifies the three critical problems with the applicability of current cost and risk models to distributed small satellite missions and uses data-based modeling to suggest changes that can be made in some of them to improve applicability.

  abstract = {In recent years, commercial exploitation of small satellites and CubeSats has rapidly increased. Time to market of processed customer data products is becoming an important differentiator between solution providers and satellite constellation operators. Timely and accurate data dissemination is the key to success in the commercial usage of small satellite constellations which is ultimately dependent on a high degree of autonomous fleet management and automated decision support. The traditional way for disseminating data is limited by on the communication capability of the satellite and the ground terminal availability. Even though cloud computing solutions on the ground offer high analytical performance, getting the data from the space infrastructure to the ground servers poses a bottleneck of data analysis and distribution. On the other hand, adopting advanced and intelligent algorithms onboard offers the ability of autonomy, tasking of operations, and fast customer generation of low latency conclusions, or even real-time communication with assets on the ground or other sensors in a multi-sensor configuration. In this paper, the advantages of intelligent onboard processing using advanced algorithms for Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA) compliant onboard data processing systems are explored. The onboard data processing architecture is designed to handle a large amount of high-speed streaming data and provides hardware redundancy to be qualified for the space mission application domain. We conduct an experimental study to evaluate the performance analysis by using image recognition algorithms based on an open source intelligent machine library “MIOpen” and an open standard “OpenVX”.

  doi = {10.1109/AERO.2018.8396740},
  abstract = {Telemetry data received from satellites during in-orbit operation are typically analyzed by experts to identify faults that might lead to potential subsystem failures. A typical method is to apply limit-checking procedure to locate off-nominal features which do not fall within the expected normal range of values. Human-experts' analysis is usually limited. It focuses on analyzing selected group of features that would interpret a specific situation that might be taking place onboard the satellite. When the size of telemetry features and number of observations are in the order of hundreds or thousands, a full expert-based analysis is almost impossible to achieve. In this paper, expert-based analysis is leveraged by the automation of the telemetry analysis process based on a machine learning technique called the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). LAD is a pattern recognition and classification approach that combines ideas and concepts from optimization, combinatorics and Boolean functions. One of the main advantages of LAD is its explanatory power, which offers a classification and an interpretation of the root causes of the events under study. Patterns generated via LAD are easily understood by experts as they are constructed from the features within the set of observations. Consequently, LAD is used in numerous practical applications. We are applying LAD in the process of fault diagnosis and prognosis in satellites by combining the domain expert's knowledge and the knowledge extracted by LAD. The procedure begins by performing a fault tree analysis (FTA) and a list of corrective actions, by domain human experts. This analysis is usually limited by the expert's knowledge to represent known faulty states of the system. However, operation data collected over a period of time can introduce meaningful hidden knowledge about faulty states that were not represented in the original FTA. We apply LAD to find this hidden knowledge in data collected through simulation, testing and in-flight operation. The results reflect significant interpretation power and an effective leverage of the obtained knowledge by the integrated telemetry analysis tool when compared to traditional limit-checking method.},

  doi = {10.1109/AERO.2015.7119024},
  abstract = {The Boeing Company is designing, developing and manufacturing the Core Stage and Avionics for NASA's heavy lift rocket, the Space Launch System (SLS), which will support missions beyond low earth orbit for the first time since the Apollo days. On the SLS vehicle many sensors are selected and used to provide critical information for testing, ground operations, and vehicle flight environments. Appropriate data acquisition systems that can interface and process the selected sensors is important to the success of the program. In this program, multiple data acquisition systems are used to interface with sensors at various development stages of the SLS vehicle, and at different sensor criticality levels. These phased configurations of data acquisition classes and complexity range from gathering sensor data during system level testing at Stennis Space Center (SSC), to transmitting flight information after liftoff at the Kennedy Space Center. One challenge that engineers are faced with pertains to how the data acquisition system is defined prior to understanding the quantity and type of sensors required for the application. This paper focuses mainly on the SLS flight system and provides a general overview of the system architecture. The paper also addresses the strategy used to define the data acquisition system, along with the methodology for selecting data acquisition cards that fit with the application.},

  doi = {10.1109/AERO.2002.1035295},
  abstract = {The TechSat 21 satellite program is an Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) technology initiative which has an objective to demonstrate and validate microsatellite cluster system concepts and enabling technologies. The primary experimental objectives are to demonstrate formation flying algorithms and technologies for clustered satellites, and to demonstrate autonomous cluster and spacecraft operations. TechSat 21 consists of three satellites which will fly in various configurations with variable separation distances. Command and control of a cluster of satellites with multiple heterogeneous experimental objectives poses several challenges from a ground perspective. To assist in operating TechSat 21, AFRL is developing a backroom Mission Operations Center (MOC) which will be capable of performing, among other tasks: planning and scheduling; command generation; state-of-health (SOH) monitoring; telemetry playbacks; fault detection, isolation, and resolution (FDIR); data storage; and payload data analysis. The objective of this paper is to describe the MOC architecture, highlight the key components, and outline its planned operational use.},
